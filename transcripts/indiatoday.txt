I am saying Supreme Court is supreme but

not infallible and as the pasola board

has rightly said we are not satisfied

with this judgment and Mike grievance my

question is had the must've not been

demolished on 6th of December 1992 what

will happen a judgment given today had

the idols not been placed in 1949 what

will happen in judgement at every each

and every step there is a pattern of

injustice

those Supreme Court is supreme it is not

infallible interesting those Supreme

Court is supreme it's not infallible say

the opponents of the way the verdict has

been framed

others are hailing the verdict as

historic the big questions

will this IOT Evonik really bring

lasting peace have judges given a

balanced or a one-sided verdict is it

time to forget the past and simply move

on will the politics of ayothaya now

finally come to an end

how will the idea judgement shape

India's future will those responsible

for the Babri Masjid demolition be

punished a criminal act as described by

the course joining me now Swapan

Dasgupta bJP MP of the Rajas of our

nominated MP I'm also joined by Scheid

Siddiqui chief editor of the weekly

night duniya himself a former MP because

seeing is senior advocate who appeared

for the Hindu Sabha Mesaba in the in the

court I am also going to be joined in a

moment by Sanjay Hegde senior lawyer and

Rajiv Pratap Rudy bJP MP Swapan task

let me come to you first how do you see

this verdict do you believe that it

provides a healing touch or the very

nature of the verdict means that it is

in a sense imbalanced in that one side

today can genuinely claim it has now got

the entire disputed land is it a

balanced judgment or is it a one-sided

judgment rightly the first thing I think

we must all breathe a sigh of relief

that there is a final closure to a

dispute which appear intractable which

has been persisting for well over a

century and which certainly has been

persisting in a more virulent form since

the 1980s this is a dispute which is

divided Indian politics this is indicted

in it has united parts of society but it

is also left to learn large section of

society hostile so finally it was the

desire of everybody and if you remember

remember the 90s the whole thing is this

must be settled in a court of law this

must be settled in a court of law this

must not be done through agitation that

was the recurrent theme all along so

it's gone to a court of law it's gone to

the highest court of law and the highest

court of law using either legal methods

or methods of arbitration have decided

that this is the best way out of this so

I think under the circumstances yes I

personally feel very elated at the fact

that Ram temple which was suddenly a

desire of a very large section of the

Indian population right and whose

significance is more than religious I

think that is coming to a fruition and

to that extent I hope I can understand

the feelings of those who say that the

Supreme Court is not infallible yes of

course they are humans after all but at

the end of the day you have to ask

yourself the question do you want this

dispute to persist do you want to find

the closure of it oh I I think under the

circumstances and given the restraint

and the responsibility and the sobriety

with which this judge

has been greeted by everybody including

those who feel a bit aggrieved I think

overall I think the atmosphere is very

good and I think this is a positive

indication that we can actually put any

form of divisive Ness behind us so you

are saying that you believe the

judgement will bring closure you

actually think this judgment will bring

closure and closure when I mean closure

not just in the context of the dispute

but the wider issue of the hindu-muslim

engagement no I don't think that's in

there necessarily I think it will bring

a closure to a idea but I think there

are questions which are likely to come

up where we were intellectual debates on

this whole question and which is really

the question of I would certainly like

to ask the question why today why did so

many people with positions of

responsibility and influence try to

stall the temple for so long

that's the question is certainly that

intrigues me given the fact that

everyone said let's go to the court of

law let's go to the court of law and yet

these were the very people who did

everything in their power to perpetuate

this dispute issue which made Hindus

look ugly and I think that and I and I

think those are questions but for today

I would rather not ask those questions

quickly yes those questions will

continue to agitate people like me will

come we'll come to that in a moment as I

said I want to get the big picture this

evening because I think that's what we

need to focus on shine Siddiqui you

heard Swapan Dasgupta say that he

believes this will bring closure to the

ayothaya issue per se do you believe it

will bring closure to the ayothaya issue

per se or the manner in which the court

has given five acres to the suny

brockport I saw tweet of yours

saying we should build a hospital there

not even a mosque do you see that that

vexed Hindu Muslim issue getting any

kind of closure or have been opened

fresh fault lines again

no I broadly agree with certain what I

think is that it hindu-muslim issues

will be raised some issues will remain

but it we can have a new beginning now

onwards because I've been speaking to

clerics and for long I have been saying

why don't you come to a Medi mediated

settlement they always said we can't

give the mosque if the code gives we

can't do anything about it if it's taken

by force we can't do anything about it

but we are in no position because most

belong to Allah not not to any cleric or

any individual so that has been their

stand

so now and they are always been saying

we will agree with the court judgment so

they all agree with that

in every mosque this sermon was

announced yesterday after the Friday

prayers that whatever the judgment we

will go with it so I say are you saying

Solvency I you say - I very weakly the

like a new bits from you saying are you

saying the likes of ourselves you know

we'll see or we can go to a situation

where we can resolve lot of coming

issues not only I do there but lot of

other issues can be resolved now onwards

we can make a new beginning and we

should try to make a new beginning in

our own words I agree with the Prime

Minister the way Prime Minster spoken

and about my to it what I am saying is

that there is no point in building a

symbolic mosque there is no need for a

symbolic mosque in ago they are now

because already there are many mosques

which are many of them are not used

because they are not many Muslims there

but Muslims should not reject these five

acres they should accept these five

vehicles take it but let us both take it

and then build a hospital for for the

people who will be coming there for the

people of us giorgia Hindus Muslims six

values who come there and let it be run

by Muslims that we have a symbol of

Indian secularism that will be a symbol

of Indian unity ok people coming

together so that's what I believe

because there is no need for a mosque

don't you for a moment I must move on

and where are the users well you and I

must have gone and get at abusers Venza

let me bring in all as many views as

possible because seeing you appeared in

the court we are hearing interesting

news but from shite sitting in Swapan

Dasgupta hoping in a sense that this

brings closure you are actually involved

from a legal perspective do you believe

this judgement fulfills all the tests

particularly the test of constitutional

morality because the judge is very

clearly said 1992 act of vandalism 1949

the manner in which the Ramla lider was

brought in was also completely illegal

and yet had chosen to give the land

itself to those who some would argue

were responsible for the vandalism to

that extent is the judgment

constitutionally flawed even if it is

politically wise well Rajdeep service i

just to bring in the perspective in

which this decision has come one has to

appreciate that the indian jurisprudence

is such that if even a unauthorised

occupant of land or a complete

trespasser on land is entitled to stay

in such an authorized position or

trespass except to be removed by an

authority of law so that means you have

to move the court and get him

dispossessed now in this case the

Muslims are in that situation where they

now have been found to be unauthorized

Italy on this land but they were removed

without authority of law that the the

Hindu community did not you know wait

for the judgment to come to dis possess

them but forcibly dispossessed them or

broke broke down their structure so that

that really is the connectors in which

this decision has come so ultimately if

the rightful owner is able to claim that

he is the rightful owner he is

definitely entitled to be put back in

position

he is definitely entitled to be assuage

you know his rightful ownership in this

way

in practice am i correct the rightful

ownership has been decreed by the court

on the basis of cannot only volume

limited practice also like the airship

is it about only the fact that there was

no rights no it's about evidence it is

about evidence and it is also what faith

but I'll tell you how in faith and

evidence gets intermingled in this case

the position of the Muslims have even

for those 300 or 400 years that the

mosque was there in existence has not

found to be you know hostile so that

means the Hindus have all along been

going there and it has been it has been

said in the complaint of the Muslims in

1857 itself that in the baby which is

the right in the sanctum sanctorum of

the mosque Hindus used to come for

centuries and they used to you know lie

down on the floor and and pay their

respects to God so it is it has been

admitted and it is proved on the basis

of evidence that there was a joint

position of this property both by Hindus

and the Muslims as far as offering

prayer is concerned in fact the Muslims

have not been able to demonstrate that

they used to offer Nawaz uninterruptedly

but the Hindus have been found to be

offering prayers there uninterrupted

swung right the second part is that the

area itself had the kind of faith that

when there was a high court order

permitting you know how slaughter in

Ayodhya the the governor of that had

that whatever British are in sizing

probably 18 18 14 or 18 10 he disobeyed

the high court order and he said that

this space has so much of sanctity that

I will not obey a high court order and

he did not permit cow slaughter to be

done within idea and his decision was

affirmed by the crown so that means the

British also felt the crowd also felt

that whatever he has done contrary to

the High Court is correct so they

created a small segment in a giant

permitted council not only in that area

now that is the kind of faith that this

place had as far as the Hindus are

concern

and lastly as far as evidence is

concerned the Archaeological Survey

after the demolition of the mosque have

you no sound a lot of uncovered a lot of

things which are under the mosque to

suggest that there was a temple at the

same place in IO there so and and and

the the Skanda Purana also which is you

know found in a book in in the oxford

library in england also notices that the

sita a soy and the sita coupe you know

the given district one you know which is

up which is a well or request you to

make your interventions a little briefer

what i am only trying to show the

evidence that was there before though

yeah i that is what you provided

evidence yes let's go by what the court

said in the thousand and fortified a

paid judgment and one of the things they

did say was the act of nineteen ninety

two was a criminal act

so court has also said that it is also

said of evidence said yes but they've

also said that the act 1920 degree was a

criminal act and therefore that brings

me to the question sanjay agree has the

court been able to harmonize that the

concept of the act of vandalism of

december 6 1992 with the issue of the

central tide to dispute and the evidence

that was provided to suggest that there

was continuous and uninterrupted worship

have they been able to harmonize it that

was a temple hindu or you see what the

court has attempted is a very delicate

balance the problem about attempting a

balance is that sometimes it's only time

that we tell whether you have fallen

between two stools so here what the

court has done is it has it has said on

the archaeological evidence it that

things are inconclusive as to whether

there was a temple which was demolished

to make way for the mosque

it has also held that the 1949 act of

putting in idols there was an act of

desecration of the mosque it has a third

it has held that 1992 the demolition was

a violation of the rule of law having

said all that when it comes to the

question of evidence on who has been

able to prove title it has it has

analyzed all the suits the pleadings the

and finally said that both suits that is

the hindu suit as well as the muslims

would have to be decreed having decreed

both suits how do we mold the relief in

the question of molding the relief with

the a it is where the court has given an

alternate site to the Muslims using its

power and article one forty two of the

constitution now these are all steps in

a process to get to get at the ultimate

order whether they thought of the order

first and and then provided the

reasoning or whether they reasoned it

out first and then provided the order

that can and legal historians and

pueblos like me will go on endlessly

debating can I do can I stop you for a

moment

can I stress change of my mind as a

legal historian yes very quickly yes

please

very quickly tell me no my point at the

moment open desert my just a minute

mistake they Iook West all my panelists

to be a little brief with their comments

I know that this is a complex issue but

I want to get in everyone Swapan

Dasgupta there are two aspects to it

there is the civil title suit which has

been decided today and has come very

firmly in the belief that there are no

Bhumi Nia's should get the disputed land

the other aspect is the criminal aspect

and the criminal aspect involves what

happened on December 6 1992 which the

court has clearly said was an act of

desecration you when you speak of

closure do believe closure must involve

punishment of those responsible for the

criminal act can be divorced the

criminal act from the title suit

I believe we can I think there's a

parallel process going on about the

people who are responsible for the

demolition of 1992 which is going on and

I presume will go on but I think would

you have to realize more than that and I

think all the evidence would suggest

that there was a gaping wound up gaping

wound in the hearts of Hindus who felt

dispossessed from a sacred shrine which

they considered their own and for

various reasons whether this was brought

about by an act of original vandalism or

not is a matter of historians to daily

debate but the fact is that there was a

certain direct action which was taken in

1949 and there was a certain direct

action which was taken in 1992 and which

stemmed from that feeling of hurt

the feeling of deprivation and today I

believe that the court has addressed

those looked at the evidence and found

meaningful evidence to suggest that yes

there was then there is a fit case for a

long temple to be built in idea and I

knew against the weight of both must

happen coterminous Lee it is part in

foreclosure for divorcing it I am saying

what about those who lost their lives as

a result of what I'm going to say you

can continue with the criminal you are

you the lot of people lost their lives

in fighting for the temple let's not get

into that there are I'm in Calcutta and

there are the two brothers the Qatari

brothers who lost their lives in in this

was shot down lot of people lost their

life so let's not look at it in one way

or the other so the impor important

thing is that there was an outstanding

grievance there have been outstanding

grievances but this woman was the one

which was catapulted to the top of the

national agenda and I think that

grievance to my mind has been resolved

but the criminal action

if you want to continue if that

continues yes that's a parallel process

and I guess it must continue okay so

you're saying it is possible to

distinguish the two is that enough

therefore to then have new beginnings as

Scheid Siddiqui puts it is this a moment

for new beginnings let's take a break on

that point how do you find new

beginnings after such a torturous bloody

past such an acrimonious polarized past

is what I will raise as I as we head

into that break listening to what she

she Ravi Shankar who was appointed a

mediator by the Supreme Court a

mediation process that failed had to say

when I asked him this question back in a

moment your first reaction three she to

what you heard today from the court is

it a balanced nuanced judgment is it a

one-sided judgment how do you see it no

it's a historic judgment which has done

justice to both communities there is

nothing to be clear about so it has

taken the consideration it has taken

into consideration the sensitivity

sensibility of the issue and everyone

should welcome this verdict and I think

it's beginning a new chapter

today's eleven nine so it's a different

form of 911 that world will always

remember we're both communities are

given justice and you're saying this is

your CCG you're saying both communities

have been given justice the five acres

land for the Muslims will become

important where do you think that should

be should there be a moratorium on all

further claims like Kashi and Mathura so

that there's a sense of true closure now

that you know that that will that the

government will decide yupi government

central government will say where they

should get it with the Saudi buckboard

so it is there you know let me closer to

all other issues sir thank you should

not be closer to all our issues kashi

mathura i think this is a i think that

the whole contention was only with this

place right now and this has been

resolved and we must all be very happy

about the central question i want to

pose today will the eye

verdict the unanimous verdict lead to

new beginnings the hindu-muslim compact

toggled with over the years now the

temple town of IOT i itself breathe a

sigh of relief today as the Supreme

Court pronounced the verdict it was

peace I hope they had turned into a

fortress and it remained peaceful after

the judgment Preeti Chaudhary and uncle

Ali report from Ionia I Oh Tia heaves a

sigh of relief as the Supreme Court

settles the decades-old title dispute

the temple town had turned into a

virtual fortress ahead of the verdict io

death didn't see any major untoward

incident by enlarge residents of Ayodhya

from both the communities accepted the

verdict with grace

son of the oldest sorry the Saints also

welcome to verdict for them

subdivided town within 30 minutes today

the Supreme Court ended a historical

dispute a dispute that had led the

political the religious narrative of

this country for decades but possibly

with this end will be new beginnings

especially for a udya and the people of

failed here

reporting with anka theology and

cameraperson Mohsin Khan in Orillia

Preeti Chaudhary for India today ok

let's go back to our panel and raise

that issue we are seeing these images

playing out of IOT and those images are

talking of new beginnings it are those

new beginnings really possible child

Siddiqui as I said you spoke about the

need for the Muslim community to put

this behind them and look for ahead you

believe that's possible do you believe

that's possible only through our Thea

will other issues like NRC Citizenship

Act uniform Civil Code keep coming are

we heading in a sense therefore

towards a situation where it won't be

it's not just any more about IO Thea the

government will need to tackle all these

issues or do sea of compact now possible

a new beginning

the suspicion and between the two

communities has been there from pre

partition days that led to the partition

it can't be resolved by resolving just

one issue but one beginning can be made

from here the fact is that Muslims are

in fact feeling insecure today they are

feeling marginalized politically we are

feeling marginalized in many other ways

and the way Prime Minister is spoken I

hope that he is able to bring them into

the fold more than words mr. Siddiq the

closure term when when people are able

to come together and and that requires

lot of actions lot of government and at

the social level at the political level

lot of actions have to be taken and

Muslims must understand that they have

to resolve these issues in their own

interest and but at the same time the

majority has to understand that if the

country has to move forward then they

have to take the minor reins barely such

a large in fact the second-largest

majority with them if they don't then

the country will suffer not just the

Muslims it is the country which will

suffer and therefore you have to win

over their hearts and their confidence

okay which was if Narayana ta which was

the mean P another energy a that's an

important thing Nara na Zameen Par nazar

are notch a rotten Sharda you are an

author and analysis either log Q tell us

which how do you translate this promise

of that we need to move beyond RAM and

Rahim we need to build a new India which

is based on the notion of bringing

people together how do you go beyond the

Nara the slogan

their idea to call it Nara is actually

insulting the intelligence of people if

you look at what Mohan Bhagwat gia said

and the conduct of people who are linked

to you the movement for long years none

of them has spoken out of turn

none of X them have made trifle nosy

noises and them of their and none of

them have made any kind of statement

which can be construed as something that

goes against the spirit of brotherhood

so I think this owners of putting

everything on RSS and BJP is rather you

know thin and I would say we should

stick to the spirit and this along

century spirit requires give-and-take

now when mr. Mohan Bhagwat was today

asked whether there'll be a moratorium

on Kashi Mathura should there be a

moratorium on all further demands just

as the Muslims today must concede then

respect the verdict should Hindus also

say now we don't we have no more demands

this can't be an eternal battle tomorrow

to be classy day after Mathura that must

have more backward sidestep that

critical question I am asking you should

there be a moratorium on all further

demands I do not remember I do I do not

remember any of the media people

questioning the Muslim leaders that why

they don't set off an accusation why

they are making provocative statements

when the court case was going on why

there is a delay this effort to put the

onus on Hindus and put them there and

say and katia you know in a corner is

not appreciated today's the day when

everybody has shown big heart let us

move from here why do you assume

there'll be more demands coming in to

tell you the truth because the vhp has

asked for I think from the Muslim

community me isolated I agree

those who make provocative statements

from but the BHB

given our mathura garden doors shoot

those garage be given up now Rajdeep if

you are you are an old ya arise if you

are an old journalist you know that

delta 3 when the settlement was about to

be reached muslim side or this Barbary

side put up a condition that everybody

should give a give away the right to to

ask about cash in mathura and then

acquisition broke down it will need much

more persuasive power of both the sides

close the better you cannot put the onus

wholly and Hindus so everybody has to

agree that this kind of provocative

statements like oversee made about Hindu

Rashtra and you know this is going to

live today okay it's a Hindu Rashtra

demand

no no Raj deep are you saying CA be and

as I just heard you just heard you and

is it is it's just on this channel

no noise correct agree by creating this

earth there will be no noise I ask a

question you are free to respond I am

NOT going to get into a - - mmmm with

you or residents don't make noise

that's your became half I came 35

minutes too late I made one statement

and you already upset I'm not upset I'm

saying sir that this is not a moment I

am asking you a question you're saying

CME and NRC are not community much

that's your view I asked a question you

may given your answer let me turn to

Sanjay Sanjay I agree the point which is

being made are the likes of a selfie no

way see there for a step behind the

community or simply echoing a certain

anger and resentment of their community

are they trying to in a sense provoke

the community when they say that the

Supreme Court may be supreme but is not

infallible

well that is a per statement of law and

the Supreme Court in fact has itself

published a book which says supreme but

not infallible

so mr. Owaisi at least there is using

his barristers training now what it also

occurs to me is that today a lot of

India is tired of mr. OSE leading the

Muslims or the like or the like so of a

anybody on the RSS BJP this side also

claiming to represent all all Hindus I

am a Hindu they don't represent me may I

put that clear

I a lot of India is tired of all this

thankfully is not really concerned is

there a sense of fatigue you think yes

we do not want to be hijacked do you see

your sense of fatigue no no it's not

fatigue it's no no I'm not saying

fatigue I am saying that we are sick of

all this we want to move on build your

temple build your mosque but ultimately

ROM roti here and unless India has jobs

unless India develops all this is going

to get us nowhere so please for heaven's

sake we you think that this guy gets you

what's this consolidates what's on

either side we if we are sick of this

game we want people who deliver no and

not on and not only on temples and

mosques but people who deliver jobs

people who deliver economic growth

because if you do not have peace in this

country you might as well kiss the

economy goodbye they and that is also

possibly where the Supreme Court has

given it has given an out to everybody

it has given an out to the Muslim saying

okay this is a court judgment you could

not give up the impure claim over the

land

is taking away it has given an out to

the government saying that you take the

line you build a temple if you want hmm

please for heaven's sake it is one

temple one mosque in one small place in

North India

let us not tie our ideas of religion our

ideas of faith our ideas of democracy to

just structures okay you made your point

naam lives in our hats you made your

point mr. Raum lives in the hearts

Romney's ropm lives in our stomachs okay

you made your point mistake let let

mister because seeing this one because

think from a legal perspective do you

believe that the courts have done as

much as they could to harmonize the

various interest manner now selvino ways

he turns around and says that the court

as I said is supreme but not infallible

they have done injustice to a community

do you believe that he is giving the

polar kind of polarized view that the

court wanted to resist the court wanted

to build a harmony between the

conflicting interests

well I sleep only and I'll come to this

second I'd rather go on the first point

that you raised just earlier on the

question of Mathura and Varanasi I don't

know whether anybody has spoken on your

channel there is a act of 1991 which

protects all religious places from being

converted which were whatever they were

in 1947 so that means if there was a

temple in 1947 that temple will remain a

temple not withstanding its destruction

if it was a Masjid it will remain a

Masjid but that act excludes the Babri

Masjid so it was an act actually passed

by the Congress government in 1991 to

ensure and it was basically a bargaining

chip which the Muslims had that they

didn't want to give they they were they

were didn't have problem in giving away

their but they said while giving away

idea we don't want the other structures

to be demolished so that act is not

being challenged till date and as long

as the act is in force there is no

question of converting any you know

place from a mosque to a more to a

temple etc now as far as the second

point is concerned you know the Muslims

were as per the judgement now and as for

the evidence that has come before the

court Muslims were trespassers on this

land and even though they were

trespassers by virtue of the fact that

they have been illegally and you know

wrongfully dispossessed and the

structure was wrongfully damaged the

Supreme Court has accorded to be shown a

lot of you know sort of statesmanship in

giving them five acres of land because

that's not actually a legal

determination in a civil suit the

Supreme Court has exercised its power

under Article 142 right because the

Muslims did not have any affinity to

this area they really wanted they were

really harmed they were really wronged

by a Masjid you know so-called Masjid

being demolished so by giving them five

acre of land within this 67 acre which

according to me should have been the the

final mediation effort also whatever

resulted into something like this

because as far as the Hindus are

concerned no easy

there and God does not say my vehicle

should be within the sixty seven acre

yes with an idea does it matter

no no sir I've got the judgment says in

a odinsleep no no no no I'll tell you I

have the judgment I have got the

judgment in front of me it says five

acre in the acquired area or in idea by

if it is magic in the acquired area by

the settle commit and otherwise by the

state government in there so it's

actually it's if the first choice is

five occur in the acquired land that is

to be given by the center because the

center is the owner of that land and if

not then by the government of you be

Nyonya so it's I think it's what it

should and if what we made therefore to

in some way find a way in which Hindus

build helped build the mosque and

Muslims participate in the temple

building

it's a most welcome measure everybody's

welcome this is this idea of the car you

know corporate into each other but my

blogger point is that when OSE says the

Supreme Court is not infallible it's a

good as a quotation but he had said that

they have full famous Supreme Court so

does the faith hand into their judgment

doesn't go in their favor secondly

research NJ hey Gray has made statement

that our SF doesn't present a man fine I

don't want to represent him but RSS

could be Hindu society was with this

temple issue otherwise no movement can

last for 37 long years from 1983 to

today the movement of sustained various

phase phases which means the Hindu

society by a nodules along with them

with the movement even coat is accepted

that there is a strong feeling about it

so let us not be sheared atmosphere by

putting somebody in the front or trying

to put somebody is communal or whatever

none of the statements apart from in

December 6 when the tempers were raised

because the last minute going back on

what was promised to be beginning of the

car saver apart from that all these

years not a single phase of this

movement was made let's not go down that

road again today I hope will they will

they learn the lessons will they now

believe refuted no mr. Suresh hi

everybody made Larimore than overseas

there are more than jalan is everywhere

the research movement had taken it very

soberly people sacrifice our lives there

is no violence up about yes I said that

the forceful statement itself okay was

counted a few statements I sets a

welcome would both should cooperate with

each other and start a new day can

expect hot heads of both communities to

be isolated will

Swim's isolate those who make these kind

of provocative statements and will

Hindus isolate those do you expect that

to happen or once we have elections

again people will play politics with is

that phase over today playing politics

with politics is a reality of this

country feel isolated there it's a

reality of this country that there has

been Hindu vote bank politics and Muslim

vote bank politics maybe this is an

opportunity to put that beer behind us

and actually then finally beginning

stakes has been spread by the secular

parties ok Muslim said vote bank

politics has been played by secular

parties ok not bad others who create a

sense of fear among the Muslims and then

exploit their vote ok point taken and a

good point that you make there have been

people who have exploited the fears and

anxieties of the Muslims there are those

who have exploited and emotions of the

Hindus that time has come to move

perhaps beyond that binary thank you
