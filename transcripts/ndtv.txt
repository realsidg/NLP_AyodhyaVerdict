hello and welcome you're watching left

right and center I'm Sanka the father it

is curtains on a very old case of

property dispute which then became a

matter of faith than a matter of

legality and then a subject matter of

politics before the 17th of November the

Supreme Court will pronounce its verdict

on who owns the disputed land in IOT ax

but mediation attempts had gone on and a

report has now been submitted to the

Supreme Court the walk for one of the

litigants are now deeply divided on

their position let's now quickly pull up

those graphics on screen to tell you

what exactly has happened first of all

there are three main litigants in the

land title suit you've got the near

Mejia Cara the Sunni wat board and

Ramallah garage man or the datee Ram la

la' now what has the wok Board said

we'll put out those graphics on screen

the wok board

sources say in a letter to the mediation

panel has said that they have no

objection to the acquisition of the

disputed site by the government

provisions of the 1991 act for

protection of all places of worship

should be strictly implemented that's

one of the conditions that the wok would

reportedly seems to be keeping in view

of their removal of objection the main

parties who sign this include the SUNY

Rockport nirvani akhada the parent body

of pneumonia Cara the Ram Janmabhoomi by

Shankar Acharya of Dwarka and the Hindu

Mahasabha

the wok Board can submit select lists of

the Archaeological Survey of India and

this is these are the conditions

asi mosques and committee appointed by

the court will finalize the same for

offering worship as of now the ASI sites

are out of bounds for people to offer

their prayers now subsequently what has

happened is that there are many people

within the Sunni walk vote who have now

come out and said that no

our offer or any such talk of us

offering to have no objections is false

we will continue to let the Supreme

Court decide this matter for us which is

before the 17th of November in this case

it is also very crucial to be known that

you will have a molding of relief which

is another three days for all the

stakeholders to give their suggestions

to the Supreme Court as to what do they

really expect from this case in terms of

relief now only then will the court come

out with its judgment at this moment let

me quickly introduce my guests I've got

arunachala Vaidhyanathan with me he's

been tracking this case day in and day

out for 40 long days where there what a

long journey for you has this been the

longest case of your life or some other

case which you may have covered for so

long there are other cases the overnight

hearing yeah but for 40 days treating

this is the only one okay Aarthi jerath

is here RT thank you so much for coming

they see in Puna Walla and the studio

with me as well as Geetha but she's a

political analyst with some other guests

also joining us outside of the studio

but before I go to them let me play out

this interaction I had with another

interesting person who gave a suggestion

to the Muslim stakeholders the Sunni

central wok Board by telling them why

don't you give the land as a gift to the

majority community to build a temple

because that will be the only

intelligent thing to do as of this

moment because just in case imagine a

situation that you win the court case

there will still be no scope for you to

build a mosque on that disputed site I

spoke to left in general Zameer Uddin

Shah let's play out that conversation my

first question to you is you know you

have always believed that attempting to

find a solution in this case is very

important because as you said in the

past also this seems to be a losing

argument for the Muslims so what

according to you was the

best thing to do instead of contesting

this in court no I don't think there's a

losing argument I think it is a it is an

argument for sensibility I mean for

using senses I feel that in court

verdict there'll be a winner and a loser

if we should not have any losers we

should all have winners and I say never

give up I am aware that this is rather

late in the day but still we have never

given up and we feel that an

out-of-court settlement would be the

best for the country for the amateur of

the country amateur amatory of the

country and for increasing the muslim

hindu brother mm-hmm

now a left little char there are reports

coming in that the mediation panel

report has been submitted and one one of

the points that is being spoken about

and this is by way of sources is that

the Sunni wok board will not have any

objection in handing over or allowing

the government to acquire the site do

you see this as some sort of a

breakthrough however there is a rider

not all stake holders agreed to this

solution well suddenly this offer is

very sensible but what you have not

mentioned is the riders that too

important riders are firstly there

should be no repeat of what happened in

our there the Muslims want caste and

guarantees that this will never happen

again

and secondly what we want is the teeth

should be given to the the preservation

of mooses of places of worship Act the

Amendment Act 1991 I think it does not

have teeth enough it is a very weak law

and anybody can violate it with impunity

so we want it to become more stringent I

think in case these two things are met

the Muslim Personal Law or the

[Music]

the people who have agreed to hand over

the land are well within their rights

that is the son he was born now let me I

will share your own suggestion that the

land be gifted for the construction of a

temple to the majority community has

been greeted with a lot of skepticism

particularly by stakeholders in the

Muslim side were you expecting this and

do you feel that this will this will

only go ahead and create animosity and

not find a an amicable solution I was

expecting a backlash I have received a

lot of messages saying that what I am

wrong but what they don't know is that

10 times more I have received messages

of support from a wide cross-section of

Muslims who do not want to come out

openly but they have sent me messages

saying that the stand we have taken for

a compromise for Amity for peace in the

country is absolutely correct

well the Muslim stakeholders left and

general Shah say that mediation cannot

mean that we give up our claim how would

you respond to that because the feeling

is that they're giving up they're giving

up the fight no we are not giving up the

fight we are adopting a sensible

approach giving up a fight is in case

you win and then are not able to

reconstruct the mosque which I have told

them is an impossibility that would be

giving up that would be surrender after

winning surrender before a court verdict

if we reach an agreement it is not

giving up the fight it is just a move

towards peace and Amity all right life

in general siya my final question to you

before I let you go there are in fact

mamas that usually when people try

mediating and try offering solutions

perhaps and more so in a case like this

they may be doing it out of some

interest political interests if

you were particularly in this case have

you ever been pressurized or told to say

what you do or the suggestion that you

gave by a particular political party our

political interests let me tell let let

me make it clear I have never been

pressurized right during my service of

40 years in the Army and also when I was

vice-chancellor of a legal Muslim

University because people know me well

enough I will not I repeat never and not

ever succumb to pressure

alright let's deep dive into a

discussion now on what are the

possibilities no we are not going to

discuss what the verdict is going to be

that is going to be decided by the court

but its political impact what does this

mean for the stakeholders Karthik Chopra

is the spokesperson of the Nimmo he

acara he's with us sqr Ilias is the

advocate and member of the Muslim

Personal Law Board he's also with us mr.

Zafar sorry shuara the former Chancellor

of the Maulana Azad National hoodoo

University will also join us in just a

short moment thank you all of you all

ladies and gentlemen for being a part of

this discussion let me begin with you

Karthik now you've seen that suggestions

are being made Karthik on a number of

occasions of course there is deep

division within the Muslim Personal Law

Board beg your pardon the Sunni central

wok Board where there are reports and

suggestions that they will not have a

problem if the land is acquired by the

government to a point where there are

other stakeholders were saying that

absolutely we will have a problem we

will we will continue to wait for the

court's verdict at a time like this my

fundamental question and I'll ask this

to of necessarily us also do you think

mediation could have avoided this

problem I mean right now with a court

verdict as left in general Zameer Uddin

Shah said there will be a victor and

there will be a loser a mediation would

have ensured an amicable solution as far

as far as our akhada is concerned we

participated in the first round of

mediation because we had hoped to have

direct discussions with the sunni

central work pod which is the other

contesting title that did not happen and

was reported by our lawyers to the

Honorable Court as well thereafter in

the second round of mediation of punches

decided that we will not be

participating because we are already

involved in the hearings in the

Honorable Supreme Court and till we

present our full hearings and are able

to present our case in full we are not

going to take any alternative stand at

any other location as far as all these

Muslim organizations are concerned who

are offering to give up it's a very

noble thought if the sunni central worth

what we have not been informed by them

officially or by anybody else

if the sunni central wa court is willing

to give up its suit in favor of nur

mooyah cara we welcome that if not then

we will just wait for the Honorable

Supreme Court to pass its judgement

which will come within the next four

weeks there after so many after such a

marathon hearing and so much of effort

put in by the Honorable judges so much

of time of the Honorable Supreme Court

being taken over this issue at this

stage they have come out with this

proposal apparently and that also is a

divided house because half of them are

saying that we are against it correct

half of them say we are for it

their chairman has one view nobody has

any view and if he gives up in favour of

who the moment you say we want to give

up opens up another Pandora's box said

who will take possession acquisition

Biden above you we we please go back no

please go back to that entire two point

seven seven acres within that two point

seven seven acres originally it was only

the inner so-called inner courtyard area

which was in dispute which was attached

on five one 1950 the outer courtyard got

attached later the remaining area got

attached after the demolition of eleven

temples of the near Mui acara

which were situated there including

loves ones understand this was done

during Kalyan Singh government's time we

challenged this acquisition which was

done supposedly for public purposes

along with five other Muslim parties

High Court and u P struck down this

acquisition on the 11th of June or

December 1992 later we have the smile

Farooqi judgement and others which

clearly say that whoever is the winning

endowment out of these title suits which

are ongoing in Supreme Court will be

able to get back all its as much land as

it requires to build whatever be its

religious structure now why should we

agree to giving up that acquired land

already acara's

punches are clearly directed when this

in case of their final they're like this

year to give up the acquired land just a

second just a second to give up the

acquired land they had said that they up

and hand over some of this land to

another organization our punches are

opposed this and instructed our lawyers

to please kindly file objection that is

still lying in the Honorable Court

therefore the whole issue is give up

give up in favor of who if you are going

to give up to the near mooyah Cara we as

the shabbiest of Bhagwan Shree Ram Lala

Raj man I'm very happy to accept your

giving up in our favor okay okay but had

that been the case then this matter I

mean settled amicably in the past also

it would not have reached the Supreme

Court mr. sqr Ilyas let me come to you

now so nice rental Bluff word is always

welcome to clarify what it has to say

who they want to go okay okay mr. mr.

yes

now I'm only and only talking about this

confusion which has now come about

particularly as far as the Muslim

stakeholders are concerned what do you

make of this There is obviously a sense

of confusion now you know Sony

sandalwood and Sony Central Board is not

one man body it tastes a comprising of

seven to eight people's so it was not a

unanimous decision and that - it has not

come before the Supreme Court so I

cannot say anything about that because

Sony is a central vac board is their

body of seven to eight people if they

want to involve in negotiation or if

they want to surrender whatever they

want to do that has to be taken by the

entire any work would and that should be

Ronnie with this Jen so you're saying it

is means nothing so what board is not a

yeah it is nothing it is nothing almost

nothing but who don't you don't you

worried that this will send out a very

wrong message of deep division within

your own ranks that you don't speak on

unison they don't have no effect on a

division you know you know in this

particular case in this particular case

there are eight litigants from Muslim

side Sony central what is one one of

them so Sony and secondly Sony said it

is not the decision of the Sony Central

Board it is the decision of one person

that is chairman of the board I and that

- where has the chair

for the Supreme Court so we cannot say

anything these are some the okay

whatever the case these are the rumors

so he has not confirmed that he has said

that thing

no no whatever you say yes you're saying

that he's the chairman and on the other

hand you are saying these are rumors can

you please clarify as of this moment I

hope you realize that this is a very

serious case when you when you when you

relegate this all right all right

when you verify and say that these are

you know from the Chairman no less the

Chairman can you clarify what is your

official position listen to me yes yes

really nothing has been communications

of the morning buddy has community

coming up this is coming out in the

channels that mr. Lockwood is

withdrawing the case but such such type

of thing has not come before the court

today so how can so unless it has not

come before the court how can we say it

can be reversed

unless it is played before the court and

court have would have received this that

Sony Central from World War okay as of

this morning this is like this moment so

listen as some sort of a this this will

be seen as deep division in your ranks

this will be seen mr. Ilias as nothing

but deep division not a division at all

it is not a division at all okay okay

Karthik Chopra as well as mr. Elias I'm

going to come back to you in just a

short moment let me now quickly come

back to my guest in the studio the

politics of it right where they are we

going to get into the legality in just a

short moment but first the politics of

it Aarthi Jarrett they seen pune wala as

well as dr. Park do you feel that

there's this third dimension the third

and one is one is the aspect of faith

the other is the aspect of legality and

the third is the aspect of politics do

you think it's this third aspect which

will have its bearing or its impact post

the 17th of November whenever this

verdict comes out particularly for a

party like the Bharatiya janta party you

know the party tanta party has made this

into their issue since 1986 following

the pollen poor resolution and it has

included the construction or

Ram temple in ayutthaya in every

manifesto since 1989 so it is very

clearly although they claim it's a

matter of faith

but it really goes beyond faith it is

really a political issue the rise of the

BJP can be attributed to the fact that

they picked up this issue and made it

into their main flank from 1989 onwards

if you remember if you go back to the

history of the junsang you know the the

revocation of article 370 was their core

issue but they never ever became a big

party in all those years using this

issue it was only when the BJP picked

aplomb Monday that the BJP is rise

actually started so it is very much a

political issue and I would like to go

back to what the prime minister said in

an interview just before the elections

where he was asked this question on the

Ram temple and he was asked about the

demands from the RSS that they should

bring in a law to build a ram temple and

he said very clearly that he will wait

for the judicial process to be over and

after that the government will do what

it thinks necessary or what it deems

think and to my mind I mean if I read

between the lines I think he was keeping

the window open - so let the Court

decide what they have and then there'll

be a food will be a political decision

and the government will be very much

within its right to in any case the land

is with the government the government

acquired during near Samarra oust any on

the land is with the government and the

government can then pass a law to build

a temple which is I think what the BJP

would like to do it is a long-held

promise and they would like to fulfill

it like their fulfilled article 370 they

do another one okay now that one of the

core is there is happy everybody got a

box provided there is whatever the world

whatever the verdict okay they are going

to get into the what the verdict is

going exactly I don't know what the

verdict is but I think that as far as a

government is concerned it would be

within I mean I think mr. Veda nothing

can correct me if I'm wrong but it would

be within the government's purview to

you know sort of since it has aligned

with with it it can just reiterate the

acquisition and then you know pass a law

to build a temple okay desi

you know I honestly don't know where to

begin and where to end so let's get a

couple of things I mean I'll start from

ever Artie ended with the Honorable

Prime Minister's interview what the

Honorable Prime Minister therefore is

saying is the same man who wax eloquent

about the of the majesty of the

Honorable Supreme Court has basically no

respect for the Honorable Supreme Court

should the judgment go against what is

the promise of the BJP

he will then bring in a law to build a

temple so his way or no way there is no

even kneeling and I put very literally

make my point

now obviously the BJP s rise has been

meteoric because of the ramen there so

deathcap Rahm Jean attempt in in a tent

and that's been them a Tory Christ but

the larger point has been this now I

want all your viewers to bear with me

let us imagine a hypothetical situation

where a chief minister in this case

Kalyan Singh with a BJP chief minister

promises the Honorable Supreme Court

that a temple and using the word temple

will not be broken down a mob then

descends breaks down the temple would

that mop today be in power no justice

has been delivered I am NOT getting in a

dispute whether this was a mosque or

what was it up structure was this was

broken down that matter may be a

criminal matter happening day to day no

justice has been served those people

have continued to be in power would that

happen with the Muslims no my entire

constitutional rights were taken away

point number two now let's come to what

RT says the Prime Minister says look if

nothing happens we can then bring in the

law it's happened with some I mean I

mean I mean between the lines I mean

really between the lines now that's in

Sabri mala we've had none less than the

BJP president taking a completely

different stand on the Supreme Court now

let's come to the point this is not just

a Hindu Muslim dispute legally this

dispute is also a Hindu Hindu dispute

between the male moyer color which

Karthik represents and Ramallah which

has been represented starting with

Agarwal and other people who claim Allah

Allah is ours only we are I agree with

that I agree so there is a claim to be

made innocent mr. Vaidhyanathan and mr.

president I have claimed otherwise but I

agree that you've also made that claim

that you all are the original

representatives of ROM Lala so there is

that dispute as well which is why even

they shouldn't be a threeway division

why is this continuously being portrayed

as a Hindu Muslim and Karthik is right I

agree with Karthik a if the Sunni

buckboard gives up the land in favor of

whom nirakara or Ramallah in favor of

whom who's there who's what is this this

is a civil dispute in my opinion and

there's a criminal act that was involved

in the structure is when will justice

would that happen okay when we get

justice okay okay okay doctor but before

I get into the legal aspect my question

to you is the party Janata party's

promise in its manifesto and the

language which changed periodically

right I want to know from you your

assessment if you allow me very briefly

I want to read out since 1996 how the

wording on ROM temple promise changed

for the BJP so in 1996 in their

manifesto they said that there will be a

magnificent Ram temple at the gemston an

idea on coming to power as this is the

dream that moves millions of people in

our land in 1998 the BJP is manifesto

says the BJP will explore a new word

added all consensual legal and

constitutional means to facilitate the

construction right then in 2004 it says

BJP reaffirms its commitment to the

construction of round temples no promise

no extra objectives nothing again in

2009 the BJP says it will explore all

possibilities including negotiations and

judicial proceedings to facilitate the

construction of the Ram temple in 2014

they say that they reiterate their stand

to explore all possibilities within the

framework of the Constitution to

facilitate the construction of the Ram

temple a language they retain in their

2019 manifesto as well do you think that

there was an attempt by the Bharatiya

Janata Party to initially sell this as

their big poll plank then later

realizing that maybe this issue is not

working out and as you see it's slowly

evaporating from the manifesto and then

it coming back with all the legal you

know adjectives that have been put in

the manifesto

songket - to begin with first since you

you put it for that we are not going in

to go we are not going to go into what

would be the judgment right so what I am

saying is that they were the the other

panelists actually came forward with

this hypothesis if this happens then

this what is going to be the result so

I'm not going to go into that and the

fact remains that you know while it has

been a long wait of 500 years and it

seems that now somehow the you know the

Indian society and Indian people they

have reached that stage of vindication

while this closing of the hearing of the

one of the longest-running cases has

taken place the fact remains that there

is first of all it is the you know

cultural ethos of of this nation which

we which have been which have been stood

to the or which have been standing

through this judicial interrogation all

this while and one political party any

XYZ one political party it stands along

with it along with it reinstating of the

culture because when we talk about the

it is not just about faith it is also

about reinstating our Indian heritage

and Indian culture that is one of the

seminal comment has given this affidavit

it was right but now the fact is if is

talk about ordinances Parliament or know

what I mean this discussion that I can

complete my argument

I wanna speak please let me complete

very quickly please let me know you're

not letting me I'm freaking on facts but

you were speaking with hypothesis the

point is that while all this the fact

remains is that whatever arguments have

taken place in the court in the last 40

days the you know the Muslim side

arguments have been very very weak and

you complete meltdown took place today

the way we saw we are very esteemed

so-called esteemed lawyer it was

appalling to see someone tearing off

just because they felt that their

arguments are not going their way now

the point is that what is important here

nobody talked about what the realities

conclude yeah my conclusion is let's go

back to one political party which stands

with the temple and there were many

others who stood against the temple but

the fact remains that who the Indian

people okay the Indian society what they

want okay so I I'm going to quickly come

back to which political party stands

where and which political party as of

this moment has declared mum as the word

because because they're once bitten

twice shy with article 370 and the

position that they've taken

I lost their scene also this question

where they let me now come to you forty

long days right I remember in the

evening I asked you a question

it took more than a year for just the

documents to be translated into English

when this matter came to the Supreme

Court if you can just Chronicle for us

stuff that people need to know about why

this case is legally so important not

just for the courts but for everyone

you see if it's a property dispute in

some other case he totally over within a

week it's just a property there is no

legal I mean constitution bench to sit

in to interpret some sort of laws it's

nothing like that

since it's as you said politics emotion

faith everything is in also court said

let's see initially people tried

object to it you may recall a couple

Sybil saying when before the election he

said have it on 2019 sweet so now

finally 40 long days sweet Chief

Justice's very strict person he never

allows to give some nonsense in

statements or Nestle wasting the time he

kept quiet and all the judges in the

bench also kept quiet because it's a

very sensitive issue

suppose if you stop someone then another

person will say in fact dr. Rajiv Dhawan

day for yesterday cold the judge is

saying that you are asking only a

question to Muslim parties by not Hindus

so yesterday Chief Justice pacified Evan

saying that are we right we are asking

questions to Hindu side also so this is

very sensitive so it has to be handled

very carefully so that's why if you are

known today so lot of things went on be

today being the climax just like a film

fortieth day so huge crowd in the court

and in one of the mean see acrimony

heated exchanges even dr. Thurman and

went on tearing some map of a book

what's the factual position on the

tearing of the map see factual pushes to

the map torn or not yes city of stone

was torn it was tall till you see see we

can sing appeared for Indo Maha Sabha no

equal to the book and the one was saying

that this is not on record please don't

take it but because Singh said T is not

koti is only showing the map then Devin

objected to it then he said I will tear

it off Chief Justice said doctor the one

you can go ahead and tear it off so he

told off then after that what happened

so this news went viral in the post line

session diamond came back and said the

told Chief Justice saying that this is

news going on virally and one of the

judges also said in the lunchtime they

also saw it on TV so Chief Justice said

you can issue a clarification saying the

Chief Justice only set it with this

permission you tore expose what he wants

any 1xb

one to us but I went to point a point of

legality over here whether I want to

know and I think this will be of

interest to a lot of people in this

country the Supreme Court has given

three days for people to put forward

their arguments or their version of what

they feel will be relieved this method

or this process is called molding of

relief for the benefit of our viewers if

you could tell us and educate us what

does this mean to make it simple yeah

suppose there is a compensation to be

paid in any accident case first of all

does this happen in all cases almost

okay so in civil cases in civil case

okay so what I'm supposed there is an

excellent compensation has to be paid

both parties are that the person who has

to pay you will say I will pay 10 lakhs

then she judge may ask what's were view

he may say no no maybe 15 lakhs so they

will say they will give their opening

what to do then finally Court will

decide on Aman this is this is before

writing the judgment so normally every

judge will want to move

what sort of relief they want so that it

can be reflected in the judgement so

this is the same thing they've asked but

interestingly so all parties they want

their own portion 1 there will be given

to each all the 3 parts to be given to

them so that's why imitation failed yeah

so what sort of relief they will yeah

can be I mean there's you know molding

forget about Zakir can this one evoke

more say no no we will take only

one-third we can say ok ok so the the

the litigants now the stakeholders now

Karthik do you feel do you feel that

that mediation molding of relief mr.

Ilias this question is to you also

Karthik first moulding of relief you

know do you see all tools I mean after

this every possible tool legal tool in

this country would have been exploited

would have been used do you feel that a

chance should be given in the moulding

of relief to work out a formula to work

out to see the mold a more we as we are

still working we are still working out

with our lawyers what will be the

moulding of relief what is it that we

will present to the hall your thinking

on those as far as mediation concerned I

am still as far as mediation is

concerned I am still

one thing that we have never ever had

direct discussions with the Sunni work

more face-to-face so that is that is

what our punches said about mediation

that never happened

where we had a one-on-one with them to

understand what they wanted to do know

what's stopping you

you can meet they have always welcomed

them to come but they don't want to

they're there we have always we are

always ready to meet them it's an open

invitation to them to have a direct

discussion with them at any time but see

you later the day buddy has been really

Asian for the second time our people no

no we have we have mentioned this from

the beginning not late in the day since

the beginning

no I'm saying now it's late in the day

but missed a chance 19 2010 no no no

before the judgement is High Court in

2010 in writing we said the original two

contesting parties near Maria Cara and

SUNY central what Watkins can have a

discussion well how nice this was man

and instantly the Honorable Chief

Justice Bharucha at that time mr. leas

how nice would that have been where the

two stakeholders would have met face to

face with no intermediary and solve this

yes yes yes we have to make it some

utopia also only why this never happened

because the mediation committee did not

do that

they met individually they did not bring

all the people together so it is it is

it is the fault of the mediation

committee not not us me we are demanding

that the the party should sit together

and they should negotiate with each

other in in presence of mediation

committee but that has a knock but not

not happen and secondly as for the

morning of relieve is concerned exactly

we are also sitting with our lawyers and

we will try to come out with some

something no no I want to know mr. yes

this movement that's all those who are

watching this broadcast miss alias can

we expect any molding for there to be

relief because right now with the way

the mediations they have all give it an

outing to the honorable court within the

next three days I think we can wait till

then of course we can I'm not even

asking you to reveal it on national

television because you're supposed to

give it to the court but it will just be

an option that you

we will give it to the poor exercise

okay okay fine I'm gonna leave it there

I'm gonna leave it this let me let me

know if we come back - yeah you were

saying something mr. Lea's not only

alright we will we will submit to the

court within three days in shock okay

okay uh weather yes tell me

if tomorrow the government were to

actually go ahead with this law

you know once all this is sorted out and

everything what the Congress party

opposed it with the Congress party

opposed let's let's ask this question

you know I I mean listen who opened the

locks Rajiv Gandhi Rajiv Gandhi so you

know I mean actually this whole thing

you know began with the opening of the

locks of negativism

not a question of credit I'm just saying

that can that Congress party actually

opposed this kind of a law I don't think

it will it's been absolutely mum so far

every time Rajiv Rahul Gandhi was asked

this question during the election

campaign he did not okay

they seem they see now my point over

here is for a Congress party yes which

took a position on article 370 and had a

situation where half of your flock like

all senior leaders apart from the family

was speaking in a totally different

voice I mean you have many leaders in

Haryana many leaders in Maharashtra

poll-bound states where they took a

totally different binary opposite line

do you fear that within the Congress

party do you think there is a fear that

let's keep quiet let's at least wait

till the verdict and even post verdict

let's keep quiet so because you will not

be able to form up your opinion I mean

the BJP is position we know starting

though you don't you know the BJP how I

will expose the BJP position wow you

look at their manifesto it's crystal

clear what they want they want the

construction over on temple what the BJP

says and what it does are two separate

things clearly on the show we just

expose one life so now let me start our

teas right Rajiv Gandhi opened the locks

not just did he open the lock Rajiv

Gandhi two days before is there in a

very famous interview said it an it's on

record then I wish for a ramen there to

be constructed in late again

maybe not tomorrow maybe not a baby

narsimha Rao even brought in an

ordinance which is blocked by the BGP

now come back to today now I'll tell you

why the BGP doesn't want this to date as

of today they don't want remise I'll

tell you why with evidence because

Singha who's the representing one Hindu

Puck's not Carnegie but the Hindu

Mahasabha comes in with these so-called

maps why which is not on record only to

Delhi because the argument would have

gone further Subramanian Swamy comes in

and I in a civic dispute where is an

intervening application coming there is

a man a religious it's not been accepted

new revenue from our basket lot please

do not read kake news this is not a

public apology factually

brominium Swamy identity came in winter

why is it so important today Subramanyam

again today Subramanyam Swami came in it

was not accepted now who also delayed

now to my last point at the end you have

not answered my question I'm coming too

what is the Congress comes up and says

listen if the India okay you know the

decision to reopen that case should all

look forward that's a wise suggestion

because you know while the weather while

the are

humans have concluded in the court

clearly arguments have only just begun

in something where the Honorable Court

is going to deliver is right there where

there is telling us something very

important we must look forward to that

authority Supreme Court yeah yeah

Karthik I agree with you yeah yes

whether it's a National Broadcasting

Authority as he shouldn't advise it to

all television channels how to conduct

debates don't instigate people and

particularly some panelists they may

speak out of the way

it should not be done they've given

complete those do's and don'ts I think

it probably everything of course and and

right here on NDTV this will be followed

to the tea and I can I can assure each

and every viewer where there very

quickly I want to know that in terms of

legal options for the stakeholders I am

NOT second-guessing the verdict I am NOT

asking anyone to but I am saying that

from here on what is the legal process

in this country in terms of legal

options available for the stakeholders -

Karthik rightly said we'll have to wait

for the judgement because all options

will open up once it is once the

judgment is delivered once the judgment

comes so it's better not in the same way

as the judgment of the al-abaad High

Court was a major stepping stone in this

case and a major achievement of moving

ahead after 100 and almost 25 years in

this case the Honorable Supreme Court's

judgment hopefully will have a sense of

finality once and for all

very quickly dahab party over the

judgment of 2010 will be finally

resolved oh one interesting point is yes

Alaba I quote dismissed

nirakara as well as Sonia buckboard on

because of time barred yes so despite

that they were divided into three parts

so now they've come here it has been

argued miss nothing that has been argued

here in Supreme Court it has been argued

in the Supreme elements have been placed

by our lawyers I don't want to get into

that debating arguments away no no no I

am

I am only saying it is interesting to

note what the judgment will be on these

two points that will be very important

okay well thank you all of you all

ladies and gentlemen for joining me on

this discussion in that respect as

Cheviot rights remain in okay time for

the benefit of our viewers see this is a

very complex issue so we are taking a

break as of this moment where there has

been very kind to us and the viewers of

NDTV to explain this in an

easy-to-understand format so that you

know what we are discussing and what is

this case all about that report will

come up next after a shortly the first

court case in the Babri Ram Janmabhoomi

dispute is at least 134 years old

today the legal battles may have finally

ended on the 40th day of the hearing had

more than its fair share of drama on the

last day both sides Hindu and Muslim

petitioners lawyers repeated the

arguments and demands the Hindu side

argues that the disputed site is the

birthplace of Lord Rama and it can't be

changed

Muslim petitioners say no temple existed

at the site and Babri Masjid was built

on vacant land the mosque was demolished

by a mob in 1992 arguments were marred

by acrimony Rica's Singh the lawyer for

the Hindu Mahasabha

which is the party but not a litigant in

the case coated a book on a yo Thea but

that was opposed by Raji the heaven

lawyer for the Muslim parties Navin said

this book can't be relied upon by the

court the casting replied he wanted only

to show a map Navin said he wants to

tear off the map to which the Chief

Justice said you mr. Thurmond can do

whatever you want

immediately Deven tore the map there

were some interruptions by the advocates

has the tearing sound echoed in the

courtroom to this the Chief Justice said

decorum is not maintained in court and

it's being spoiled if proceedings

continue in this manner we will just get

up and walk out after this warning the

proceedings calm down this sensitive

matter of religion is not just a complex

legal case but also a politically very

contentious the iota of dispute centers

on two point seven seven acres of land

believed to be the birthplace of Lord

Rama but Muslims say it was a mosque

built by the Mughal emperor babur the

Raman their issue started becoming a

major political issue in the 80s

officially making it to the agenda of

the BJP had its pollen poor convention

in 1989 this was followed by since then

the party is vodka wiki article path

the issue has a long legal journey as

early as 1885 das venema hunt approached

the local court to build a canopy

outside the disputed structure but the

court rejected it then in 1949 idols of

ROM Lala were controversially placed

under the central dome outside the

disputed structure 1950 onwards various

suits were filed by both Hindus and

Muslims and it finally reached the

Alabama Court on the 30th of September

2010 The Alibi High Court in a

two-to-one majority divided the disputed

2.77 acres into three paths between the

Sunni walk thwart the near mahir Kara

and the datee ROM Lala but all the three

parties moved the Supreme Court against

the High Court verdict and in 2011 the

Supreme Court stayed the High Court

judgement finally this year of

five-judge bench headed by the Chief

Justice of India just as Ranjan Gogoi

began day to day hearings the Hindu

petitioners say faith is the evidence

Lord Ram was born here the unshakable

faith of millions in Lord Rama

itself is the proof that the disputed

land is Ram Janmabhoomi no Muslim even

attempted to enter it at least since

1934 and Hindus continue to worship at

the disputed site from 1850 the

structure before the Babri Masjid was a

Hindu religious structure and it was

demolished and the mosque was built over

it the Archaeological Survey report says

a non-islamic structure existed and the

images found at the pillars point to a

temple Muslims can pray in any other

mosque as there are 55 to 60 mosques in

a Odia alone Hindus have fought for the

place believed to be the birthplace of

Lord Rama Hindu petitions also say for

Muslims its historic mosque all mosque

are equal for Muslims but for Hindus it

is a birthplace of Lord Rama and Bert

place cannot be changed

Supreme Court should undo the historical

wrong of destruction of the temple in

Ayodhya to build a mosque Muslim

petitioners countered the arguments they

told the top court there was no massive

structure at the site and no Hindu

motives just because there is a peacock

or Lotus does not mean they're Hindu one

view is that these institutions came

into existence during the Buddhist

period but it's difficult to say when

exactly idol worship started the

judgment of the Olivar High Court is

based on conjectures and preponderance

of probability how do you do a

preponderance of probability of

historical dates the Hindu side had said

Muslims did not pray at the site after

1934 but it was the Hindus that didn't

allow the Muslims to pray at the Masjid

the law is argued installation of the

idols of Hindu deities inside the Dome

of the Babri Masjid in 1949 was a

planned tsarouchas attack photographs of

1959 show Allah inscribed in Arabic

calligraphy the pillars inside the

structure have nothing to show the place

was a temple they were entitled to

restoration of the building as it stood

on 5th December 1992 there was no claim

of title by Hindus till 1989 there was

no finding of destruction of the temple

by the Archaeological Survey of India

Muslims were in possession of the land

throat claim of title by Hindus in 1886

was denied beliefs travelogues cannot

give Hindus the title possession of

Muslims was never in doubt custom is not

a mind game and it can

be mixed but believe Muslims have been

shrunk to the little size of 433 yards

excluding the dome as per the High Court

verdict the top court is expected to

pronounce the word before the 17th of

November the date the Chief Justice of

India Justice Ranjan Gogoi retires with

a vaidyanathan shaitaan' party charge
