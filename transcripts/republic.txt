hello and welcome ladies and gentlemen

this is live edition of the Sunday

debate and yesterday we it was a

historic day when the IOT a verdict came

out many people expected that it would

perhaps stagger over a three or four

hour period there were questions about

whether it would be unanimous at all and

there was uncertainty about whether it

would be unanimous

many felt it could be a

majority-minority verdict and there was

a feeling that maybe this verdict could

be analyzed in great detail to find some

little point of internal difference

between the judges which could be played

down on and that also did not happen and

that was the most magnificent thing

about yesterday's IOD awarded so today

we've been through the tsunami of news

yesterday it's a good time to sit back

and reflect and then for the subject of

the Sunday debaters simply put the

lessons of a yogya I'll do the

introductions later

I just want both sides to first

elaborate on their initial positions on

today's debate before both sides put

their initial positions let me put some

of mine firstly I believe that there is

an industry in this country which only

and only lives off division this is a

industry which is picked up steam in the

last decade and the reason it has picked

up steam in the last decade is it

because it is a natural response of this

group this cabal this Lobby to its own

growing irrelevance for seventy years

this cabal has somehow managed to keep

hold keep a stranglehold if I might say

so over the power of paratus in this

country and it's been almost taken for

granted that whichever section that

controls power in this country whether

it is state governments state

legislatures influential bodies academic

institutions whether it be the legal

fraternity the courts the government and

of course the media

there has been a considerable hold of

this group over that apparatus in the

country now in the last seven to eight

years particularly but over a period of

a decade this group has become

irrelevant in terms of its

representation in all the mainstream

areas principally arising out of the

fact that in this country elections have

forced the Congress out you went through

a period in which you've had National

Front United Front governments and then

you have the emergence of the BJP

through the late 90s so in the last 15

years particularly the emergence of the

BJP the cyclical downturn that the

Congress has gone through and I'll make

a longish introduction has led us to a

situation where this group does not win

elections anymore and because it does

not win elections anymore because

therefore it's slowly over a period of

10 years its control over the power of

paratus has weakened now what did this

group do as a response because it

realized that it was no longer able to

control power in India what did they do

they wanted to therefore then control

institutions that control power in India

through an indirect process whether it

be the legal fraternity whether it be

the media and law and media are very

critical and then perhaps less critical

are the academic institutions and others

but law and media controlling the media

and controlling the legal institutions

controlling the judiciary was very

important for them

the Ayodhya verdict and therefore I want

to begin this with the longest

introduction I promised you that I will

speak a little less to the course of the

debate the IOD award it was very

important because somewhere there was a

feeling among these people who I call

the lobby you can call them the remnants

of the Congress which is now popularly

known as the Vadra Congress there was a

general feeling that the Ayodhya issue

could be managed in the courts and let's

let therefore begin with this premise

that that you could have delayed the

verdict the longer you delay the verdict

perhaps it would be possible to you know

get more and more political advantage

out of it did that happen no was that a

belief it could happen yes Rajeev

Darwin's arguments couple

simple arguments let's today remember

what they were trying to do they were

trying to delay the verdict the lesson

of idea in my view the first lesson of

our idea is you cannot play around with

the courts of this country the second

lesson of idea in my view is that this

country wants to move on

if you see the response to the AODA

verdict this country wants to move on it

does not want to be hemmed in to what

was happening earlier and we now need to

reconcile that we need to appreciate the

fact then I have said this repeatedly

that there is an entire generation of

Indians which is sick and tired of

politicians playing around in the name

of secularism secularism is an abused

word and therefore if I can just begin

the debate by asking both sides one

person from either side to elaborate on

their positions on this subject you can

give me your perspective let me

introduce the guest this evening to my

right summit para national spokesperson

of the BJP truffula kate curve editor of

the organizer anand Ranganathan author

and scientist who is our Jane you

representative on the program the city

swami dipankar founder and chairman of

the department foundation ari quick val

is a congress leaning political analyst

a lama Bernardino M Hassan II is the

general secretary of the All India ulema

board Shaitan Singh is a congress

anti-bjp political analyst and Nishant

Verma needs no introduction he's come

here without his Gandhi topi today maybe

is making a partner trophy now which is

more relevant for today's times let's

begin the debate we also must understand

that there is a group of people who have

been sulking since yesterday I call them

the pseudos and whether it's in social

media columns videos they are simply

sulking they do not want the integration

and unity of the country and they've

been abusing the judiciary indirectly

since yesterday so which side would like

to start on lesson survey okay which

side some it wants to make the first go

go ahead you add does he have your

permission to start he does okay

somebody go

other first and foremost congratulations

through your channel to millions of

Indians congratulation to the panel and

to you as well because this was the

longest case going on in India and we

have a closer yesterday yeah so I

believe every Indian need to at least

celebrate within if not upon poster

display that but then we need to

celebrate our judicial system number two

if you would say that there was a

delaying tactics it was delaying tactics

versus decision and decision is the one

which has won the best thing about this

judgement or not that we all need to

really take away home is the unanimity

unanimity not just among the judges

unanimity across the country barring a

few whom you call the pseudos or whom

you call the liberal gang et cetera et

cetera the lobbyists bearing them the

whole of the country in fact is

unanimous to the fact that we have won

not the Hindus nor the Muslims India has

won this anonymity is there secondly the

most important thing that we need to

take away home today is it's not on

faith but on evidence yeah that the

court has decided and come out with a

verdict the court has said that well yes

it's not in faith of anyone we are blind

to the faith of everyone in this country

well we only are looking towards the

constitution of this country and the

Constitution guarantees certain rights

to every citizen based on evidences

empirical evidences scientific evidences

the ASI the the gadget is that the tour

guides etc they have come up with this

judgment so no one needs to really sulk

in this this is a scientific judgment

and most importantly I would say in this

that remember as far as the Constitution

of India as far as secularism is

concerned this is a victory of

secularism mr. Koester because four long

years 161 years the people of this

country patiently waited way back in

1885 we had one of their lawsuits

opening up and yesterday when the

closure came one thing was proved that

we waited patiently we did not kill we

did not fight we took our recourse

through the courts of this country to

the conclusion lastly my thanks to KK

Mohammed as well here is a man who said

that there were certain historians this

dis the whole debate was about dis

torian's versus historians as well there

were some historians who were named by

KK Mohammed these people had been trying

to let cow at cow and but cow and in

bracket of dis torian's we had the likes

of Kapil Sibal he had the likes of

obviously and I would like to conclude

by saying for God's sake the media

should take a vow not to show the

statement of a divisionist that is mr.

OSE he is trying to divide this country

in the name of religion and I would say

that we all have to be extremely

responsible as has been called upon us

by the respected Prime Minister of the

country

yeh Jordan Iike or Durrani kasama he

might make as a man nahi you know as

this thank you for in initial comments

I'll come in with some of mine as this

verdict came in yesterday

there were two events which were

happening one is there was a group of

people in this country who suddenly felt

how could this happen how can you have a

verdict in half now there was a sense of

shock because what was IOT about in the

courts it was about delay it was about

wrenching it it was about as they say to

Hindi make Athena his coach ethnic

eating it with monitoring him jitna

teaching he put not batting jitna

teaching Gaona in the Muslim Korean game

or fil tanga km secular him his key

response mayor yesterday when the word

it came there was a sense of shock among

those people yesterday yoga he seek a

bassist Peter Marie Dukan a charity so I

think the lesson of my idea is that five

judges come together and they carve out

a verdict that makes the rule of our law

and our Constitution supreme the pseudo

seculars will now have to find a new

formula who'd like to start from this

side please tonight please go ahead

would like to start from this side it is

who's making the pose make the

introductory it comes from your side if

I may thank you we all respect the

Supreme Court

we all respect the Constitution of India

and India this is doubtless

the judgment has been delivered

yesterday everyone has respected the

judgment but then definitely there are

segments within the litigants as well as

country who are not accepting it in toto

and there are reasons for that the study

of the judgment along with the

documentation which was provided in the

case matter it is being studied about it

is very clear that one of the litigants

is still unclear whether they will go

for a revision or not which is near

Maria Cara and definitely some people

realize over and definitely I wish some

people realized at least now you know

they are worried this is some yesterday

this is the this is important you see

and as well as the Muslim Personal Law

Board is still unclear whether they will

go into the vision or not now that

having having said that we must

understand that a judgement needs to be

understood first off have you read my

judgement have you have you remember

coming to that so you know once you've

made a watch have you read the judgment

you did not interrupt then I'm asking if

I got the judge right have you read the

judgment yes I have gone through the

sixth I've not slept all night not in

because of in reading you've slept all

that that's been mentioned from you

eating the judgment I've been reading

the judgment I've only been writing an

article for the lie of I have been only

able to do a 65% of reading till now it

is a long judgment anybody who says that

in two minutes or five minutes I can do

that then it's off the hook

so only 65% I have been able to read and

study till now it's more than thousand

pages it's not about reading a book it's

reading a judgement I must emphasize

here that very morning by the way sorry

why are you in mourning no it's good

morning it's not morning because when

you are reading a judgment it's a good

thing to do we must understand that all

the judgments can be if any lacuna is

wrong can be questioned as to your

thoughts seems to be a lot

you feel cold the only thing is I'm

putting it in a very calm manner because

it's a serious matter

okay I'm borrowing this line from some

goodbye he many times says that this is

a very serious matter I'm copying it

from you thank you that this is a very

serious matter and it has to be a judge

it has been adjudged thoroughly it needs

to be understood and digested thoroughly

try office I go to the point please I

mean are you finding it right it's an

opening comment please like the three

speed breakers already which have come

in so allow the vehicle to go slow which

I'm trying to drive there are there are

prime FS a train engines in the ad in

the judgement and those questions will

rise they have not erosion yet they'll

rise they will be questioned that's it

what more do you should we open the beam

a fight you know I don't want to fight

should we should we should we should

okay okay one thing is there that today

for bgo day once a BJP if I can add a

line mark isn't a party

you have been underlined by the Supreme

Court that in 1992 you did not go with

garlands so at least you as a party

shall not preach to this country about

harmony evolution this because God may I

may please now yeah but I won't and I

will tell you on the 7th of December

1992 their own Member of Parliament now

subramanyam Swami said that BG edit RSS

and vhp must be booked under Dada

so I am still not using the heavy words

that Subramanyam Swami there BJP used

because patatas was for terrorists yeah

okay now now III I just I just I I will

I will who believe it's your I know 100

do you see I wanna do this crosstalk

today night so I'm saying no crosstalk

today which means you take it through me

thank you

and Mike if we take it you take it

through me right you don't look at each

other and engage in your own

conversations if you do that I'm walking

out of the debate okay so so yesterday

let's think about what happened

yesterday what is apparent to me Nishant

from hearing you and I heard

well is that you have not come to terms

with yesterday and I I genuinely want to

tell you and chitin and everybody come

to terms with it this is now over let us

let me say this looking at each one of

you wherever you're watching this

program today this is over the moment I

say this is over

people like Michonne sitting here say no

it is not and I say when this was the

last time he says no it will not be the

last time when I say we will not have

anymore conflict he will say no we will

continue to have more conflict why

because he seeks the conflict he wants

the fight yesterday Suvarna cui came on

my program and I want to say this how

shocked and horrified I was at what she

was doing yesterday she came on my

program and she said I want a guarantee

now and I said let us let us celebrate

the verdict she said no I want to

guarantee got a body I was sitting where

you were sitting

he said I want a guarantee from the BJP

that you will now not pick up Kashi that

you will not pick up Mathura the I said

to her that I am really horrified

because how can you talk about Kashi and

Mathura today she said no I need a

guarantee wait a minute and I said but

you know have they raised Kashi and

Mathura she said no I want a guarantee

from them then I looked at her and I

said I find it completely surprising and

shocking that you are raising Kashi in

Mathura wait a minute wait a minute wait

a minute look the government is not why

you are you are raking your one-minute

one you are raking it up when you

shouldn't when we want closure you want

things to linger I'm following me

viewers and I say this to you sincerely

today that they want this to linger for

a while and then catapult again because

yoga band oh yeah doohickey occurring is

that is my only point to that the lesson

of IO dia is to understand the country

has moved on now you move on you move on

as well quietly and in discipline if you

dare to and I put a statutory warning to

you if you dare to do this again agar

aapke motto if you say Hindu Muslim

facade suru Kenickie - sorry - kitchen

Kotaku Behar cardiga carding the right

hand Pahlavi AHIMA tato in this hunt I

have I have a point to make and then

after that video permission with your

permission yeah see what I understood

whatever little I understood of what

Michonne spoke is that he's mean

let everyone see has not slept the whole

night yesterday trying to read and he

has said this umpteen number of type the

judgment needs to be understood judgment

needs to be understood saying that he

has come here to the debate today one of

the most important debates of India

without understanding the judgment and

secondly he has said that some questions

may arise in the future they have not a

rosin as yet but they may arise in the

future so this kind of caviar set in the

future we may sham the judges we may

shamed the judges we may fight against

them I would request my good friend Jean

then please don't strain your vocal

curls I mean since you have not

understood the judgment please you take

this two hours time to read the 45 pages

that are still left since 65% age top

early I must allow the debate is not

between two of no but the lessons are

yogya fatal essence of a yogi of a

subject here to interpret what I am

trying to say is respect means what

interpretation submit pathology is

simple that as you have peddle the

narrative of 370 across all elections in

in state poop you not going to peddle

this narrative first lesson second

lesson from this is that the

construction contract we come up

I will come in no crosstalk but you will

come animal tracks everything in every

unanimous address come concerns for

companies to be given the contracts or

do you see I can make my point whether

then you don't want say we see don't

speak over it so see the Animus ruffle

encouragement and on the top of it you

see they have used 142 article 142 which

Supreme Court judges can use and on the

top of it it's a 1045 pay judgment they

also what absolutely clear out here that

this is going to come up with a full

stop on politics and religion

so now onward there should not be any

politics on religion right so there's a

lot of you can ask you one question

chitin yet that politics in the end can

I ask you one thing I can ask you

anything this applies to the media as

well as you absolutely yeah

so it's not just politicians who need to

be responsible you believe the media

needs to be responsible what do you do

when certain sections of the media want

to break up the country I think it's a

time to expose them exposed UM's may I

with your permission exposed instead of

celebrating the historic judgment which

ends the dispute certain members of the

Luo Tian's media put out this article

yesterday saying how Modi's kashi

vishwanath corridor is laying the ground

for another Babri incident and and i

quote how Modi's koshy which were not

called as laying the ground for a Babri

incident certain members of the Luo

Tian's media sharing articles on the

demolition of the babri masjid titled

nation's shame when it was very clear

that it was said that don't provoke

yesterday whole countries coming

together I tell you one thing I have

been speaking to a cross-section of

people across the country yesterday can

ordinary people you know people watching

this in their homes yesterday they came

out I know that in various parts of the

country including the national capital

Hindus and Muslims came together they

had a meal together yes they had a cup

of tea together

they discussed this together and

everybody said of America and submit a

birth but the Luo Tian's media de banana

de kum Babri Masjid demolition key

visuals the karate and they wrote with

the caption

memory in the age of amnesia I mean this

kind of a line

it's a judicial deliberation you have

been saying it's a beautiful worded it's

a wonderfully constructed verdict right

some people have been calling it

jugglery the case was about the IOD

island dispute it was not about the

Barbary demolition was it about Barbary

demolition no that case is still going

on right so why is this Luo Tian's media

many of whom are doing things that are

against national interests now when I

call them anti-national they jump in

this city why calling us and pigeon but

they still have come kuroky today 0d do

but hang up go no no my question is

yesterday they said somebody said

forwarded a tweet saying first the dome

of the Babri Masjid caved in some days

later the Supreme Court's no no some

days later the Supreme Court's caved it

they were saying that the Supreme Court

was demolished yesterday you know why

I'm asking you Chetan why why reasonably

because you know sometimes what happens

people ignition today is the voice and

they think they make the I see why why

listen why why are you because you are

losers why do you want to destroy now

the Supreme Court of the country why are

you doing things against our country's

interest why you so selfish why you us

in this Lobby so narrow-minded you know

you realize the people of India hated

this Lobby now they said yesterday first

the dome of babri masjid caved in then

the Supreme Court's I accused the lobby

of being anti Nationals now tell me

give me your defense give me your

defense boom of Bob limited that is and

I said yesterday no no no why did

somebody had why did this at one one

journalist who tweeted this first the

dome of babri masjid caved in then the

Supreme Court history hinge on Marie's

know whether this is that that's our

Gandhi or somebody else if it is not the

think about what he's writing

if the Gandhi murder case was retried by

the supreme court today the verdict

would have been natural God says a

murderer but he is also a dish mocked at

today for some reason I am reminded of a

James Bond movie title on his majesty

idea verdict has to be accepted abided

new category has been admitted to the

justice system today crime of belief you

see why are you denigrating the Supreme

another yeah thanks very much and I'd

like to be having a wonderful day

name's very you know sober occasion and

I'd like to take a minute to stick to

the topic because the topic is not

deliberation of the Supreme Court

judgement it's lesson so but it's

lessons of it now I've always felt that

nations weaken not because of their past

but rather how they're taught it and for

the last 70 years what we've been taught

is to forget especially the Hindus to

forget historical injustice --is right

from kashi vishwanath to Somnath the

historical and justices have been

deliberately made visible as if to

celebrate the humiliation so this is

what we've been taught and the same

people who've taught us this around the

world they want people to fight against

historical and justices from Australia

that they want Australians to apologize

to have originals Canadians to apologize

Americans to apologize the Confederacy

general statues to be taken down in

Oxford Cecil Rhodes statue to be taken

down but in India they want Hindus to

forget the historical injustice now I'll

tell you I'll take another 30 seconds to

explain why is this happening this is

happening because they don't realize

that wounds that are not healed they

festering of you know when you the day

you eulogize tipu sultan you forget that

till this day monday i'm Iyengar's do

not celebrate diwali you know why

because Tipu massacred 800 of them

wounds never taken one second wounds

never heal when you eulogize Aurangzeb

when you eulogize barber so once again

this is why I'm trying to pull sorry I'm

sorry intervene in this may intervene

with this awful prophet also the same I

just want to say one thing to you onion

you do make your point but we do promise

today not to get incendiary yeah or

inciting and what we saw is country yeah

so I was just about to finish as Nishant

would say a great man said you know

time comes in a nation but rarely when a

nation finds this voice when you have

you step from the old to the new age

right when the utterances find a voice

and I think a rude a interesting today I

think the nation has found its voice and

the nation is saying that we will not

just not not celebrate historical

injustice --is we will fight them

legally and this is what the nation is

doing when you have 1 billion Hindus who

have put their faith in the weight of

their bad manners 1 7 with your one

point you'll have to take right so when

people put in 5 what does that mean that

means that you are going through a legal

recourse you are going to find fight a

historical injustice through legal means

now you can be hypocritical as this

Latvians cabal is and all these people

who are acting throughout the world they

want people to fight historical and

justices and here when people are not

taking law in their own hands but rather

going to the courts to correct

historical and justices you are saying

no don't do that

what kind of hypocrisy is this and this

Arnab has been rejected and will be

rejected time and time again because we

cannot let wounds fester because once

they're open they will continue to be oh

ok now now now now one second please

once just just a bit Thank You

uninformative there and I request

everyone not to get provoked or to

provoke today the one point that we must

understand is institutional integrity we

have been speaking about institutional

integrity as a word for a long time

Escondido Pantelis Cuyahoga mucho Pat

Iyer yogi Mary Hindi it Mia Cheney and a

term which every translation Quran

operator institutional integrity which

means you respect the institution is the

Supreme Court what the greatest

institution in this country it is right

yeah the Archaeological Survey quoted by

the court is a great institution in the

country and the Archaeological Survey

did say that there was a structure below

the mosque and the court quoted it and

said it was not absolutely written clear

but it made a reference to it so we must

respect it can you tell me today and we

think about it what was going on in the

Supreme Court I felt ashamed you know

this who is this fellow compensable does

he think he is he's so pompous and and

and you know walk out walk out threat

walk out threat Rajiv no one threatens

in court yeah who tried to hold all the

highest court of this country hostage

with walk out threats along with Kapil

Sibal in December 2017 may I on my thing

is the one lesson of idea mr. Kapil

Sibal for you and for you Rajiv Dhawan

humility yeah learn humility all over

again which are feet on the grass I

respect the institution where you are

built your professional practice

secondly why I say the second lesson is

Rajiv Dhawan says I quit my practice one

myth I quit I quit my practice my point

is let me complete says don't speak over

me 11 December 2017 the country watches

horrified and then and then Rajiv Dhawan

says I quit my practice after writing to

CGI justice Mishra and echoed after the

humiliating end to the daily case I've

decided to give up court practice

humility lack of arrogance institutional

integrity my I will have you forgotten

these lessons no you work do - I do you

want to say I want to get what's there

of teachers in the court there are pages

in the cop I don't do you talk

to say gold to save the fun time will be

you have me

I'm saying tonight understand we have a

responsibility upon us today as well if

others have been irresponsible in the

past we don't need to extend it today we

understand responsibility among us as

far as the judgment issue is concerned

which you are all debating on first of

all nobody is completely correct I just

want to tell you this we cannot pass

judgments on the details of the judgment

right now because truly and honestly

none of us have read it in entirety or

done a comparative assessment of it we

can come from positions where we believe

we are completely right nobody is

completely right I began the program by

saying I have not read the judgment so

so let us have the humility to

understand that but we want to go into

broader issues meb's are you wrong up

viewers our respect for Prime Minister

Narendra Modi only went up I repeat this

say what you want

our respect for Prime Minister Narendra

Modi rose when he chose not to make eye

out the central theme of his reelection

campaign for 2019 yes pradhan mantri

Narendra Modi nay I odium would take Oh

Kendra bondo monarchy of near election

campaign may use nahi kiya I think this

is a very very important thing and even

yesterday I respect for the Prime

Minister rose when he came on air and

you could have asked why he had to come

on television history came on air and he

took a statesman like position he

emphasized the fact that we now need to

move on now let me tell you what my

problem is we respect the Prime Minister

for having done that but you cannot

today typecast Narendra Modi as a Hindu

leader that's the most important point

he was not speaking as a Hindu leader

speaking as a Prime Minister believes in

genuine secularism yesterday now let me

tell you what my problem is there is

something called the National Herald of

soon eleméry but the National Herald

kirkuk aberration a apneic of paper get

here what drop arrival is co-published

intention is also I would like to I

don't know of any other treatment this

was brought to my notice mr. mr. Goswami

I have the I have the portal of national

it's unbelievable it's unbelievable the

deposits as to what national has come up

53 minutes ago and I quote the Supreme

Court of India has ruled exactly what we

should Hindu Parishad and BJP wanted

from the beginning

even after extracting that not

installing idols and demolishing the

mosque was unlawful and you'll be

astonished this is item is done like

and from Sonia Gandhi Sonia Gandhi if

you control this paper which you do then

I demand an answer on what you are up to

the national level should be pulled up

extreme it reflects their intentions

ability it reveals the reason so this is

this is this is this is this a verified

handle yes verify handle you can go

through yourself they have the photo of

Supreme Court of Pakistan over here in

this handwriting it this is coming out

from down if this is what you and you

have to condemn this and what is he so I

think it's not a condemnation he was do

you believe and I'm saying this on a

live program today let's say you believe

that Sonia Gandhi Rahul Gandhi Priyanka

Bhadra Robert Vadra and all that bad

dress should either apologize for this

or quit public life this attempt to

incite Sonia Gandhi I'd want to tell you

this if you had tried this your country

of your origin Italy Sonia Gandhi if you

had if you had tried this in the country

of your birth Italy you would have been

put in jail but national ll is

controlled by you you give an

explanation right now or apologize quit

politics or quit public life or quit

this country this is what you are doing

behind the scenes and why should i watch

and and why should i watch and allow it

11:59 a.m. today a verified handle puts

up this news may Congress end in it it

is a Congress Congress go mister go son

please allow me a few seconds I'm

disturbed why they are you they avert it

reminds us of the Supreme Court of

Pakistan how dare can someone hardware

the Supreme Court I would say the most

part of it yeah but that of Pakistan and

let me tell you this exposes the real

face of Congress many newspapers today

have come up as to how there has been a

historical change in India Ireland

remember Somnath temple secularism which

did not want so not to be constructed

thanks to Sardar Patel and Rajendra

Prasad who saw to it who saw to it that

despite the displeasure of Pandit

Jawaharlal Nehru the then Prime Minister

so not temple was constructed today

after all these years we have almost

repeat there is injustice this is how

good nationalism or daylight pillaging

of a temple called the Supreme Court of

India there is nothing less compare it

to Supreme Court of Pakistan and you see

the silence from the other side Shaitan

at least here you can't be silent no you

have to say something say something yeah

this is my karo this is part of a plan

and I want to tell you I think we should

like to apologize in a chance

they're so silent now I mean it's like

they're lost their voices not speak no

permit we say it should apologize III

apologize or anybody in this country

apologize some bit para should apologize

for what late Arun Jaitley ji said about

the Supreme Court that Indian democracy

cannot be a tyranny of the unelected so

you are with the National adult

statement that suppose for me I'm are

you

together and we say we pray for the

country to come together first of all we

pray for our country to come together we

blessed today we live in a country which

moves on but I also want to tell you

today the Vadra family does not want the

country to move on the Vadra family the

Vadra I'm seething Vadra family once a

Hindu Muslim flame I can't believe this

is a Vadra Congress since yesterday I

please check it and I'm getting a number

of viral reactions to this and I was

can I can I reply to him remember I just

want to since most of us have not read

the judgment but I have a copy a half

copy of the judgment paragraph number

it is thus concluded on the conclusion

that faith and belief of Hindu since

prior to the construction of mosque and

subsequent thereto has always been that

janmas town of Lord Rama is the place

where Babri mosque has been constructed

with faith and belief is proven by

documentary and oral evidence discussed

above so remember it's not on faith that

we are debating it is on documentary and

oral evidences and let me tell you one

man who receives a standing ovation

today is mr. Parris Aaron it is not

theatrics it is knowledge which matters

today today to discuss apologize he says

into a debate to the different mindset

altogether but now that within the

debate within that time frame it says

the article has cropped up in national

around it is a demeaning article saying

that India's Supreme Court is akin to

Pakistan and in fact I've gone to the

article in the meantime they say that

India will almost become a Pakistan if

we follow this judgement then I would

like you as the anchor of this show to

happy you know you know what they are

going to do in the course of the next

one week and two weeks internet plan

when I cannot hear that they will create

panic about caste matura kyookie

without panic very relevant so what they

will do is they will create panic about

Kashi Mathura I want to tell you he was

please don't panic there is no need to

even discuss Kashi mother I tell you why

since yesterday's a bad luck we started

it today Nishant everybody starting

about Kashi Matra yes madam please let

me tell you let me tell you one thing no

I'm speaking views you're not even on

the camera thank you I'm saying I'm

saying that why create panic about

Kashima to know about the RSS coming for

Kashi Mathura when the fact is anyone

was read the verdict yesterday we'll see

that is such a beautiful verdict the

court in the IOD a verdict in the IOD a

verdict is clearly recognized the places

of worship Act which prohibits the

conversion of any place of worship with

the sole exception for Ram Janmabhoomi

public Masjid this is such a beautiful

verdict now I'll tell you one thing for

for those who would like to be

interested in the law substantiated para

78 the law has been enacted to fulfill

two purposes first

it prohibits the conversion of any place

of worship in doing so it speaks to the

future by mandating that the character

of a place of worship public worship

shall not be altered secondly the law

seeks to impose a positive obligation to

maintain the religious character of

every place of worship as it as it

existed on the day of our independence

15 August 1947 when we achieved

independence now para 80 Qadam container

David Koch para 80 section 5 stipulates

that the act shall not apply to Ram

Janmabhoomi Bob the budget and to any

suit appeal or any proceeding relating

to it consequently that is a specific

exception which has been carved out by

the provisions of the places of worship

Act in respect of the present dispute

what does this mean it means that this

yesterday or otherwise for any other

happen I just want to come in one second

MA I'm second M for once I become a cat

lady who store

[Applause]

hurt

this cannot happen you made the point

thank you thank you thank you for your

time thank you for your time HP and you

can say the same thing calmly and then

you can listen to me see when I spoke at

least one minute please don't do that

I want to request you that we still have

about 20 minutes on the debate we should

speak calmly and three people on one set

don't speak that's all I'm saying to you

so are if you and Sean speaking makes

sure that none of you are heard now

question here is this what did I say

many clear kardia met the key is that

better as nice up to prayer is there s

any capable any the ideology as these

are many Kabbalah men crazy or intimate

or no doradito

what I have said yesterday is the people

who have been criticizing this verdict

without reading it and the problem is

that there are so many people in my

fraternity what anchors on other

channels beam up or heal leaky bin our

research couch people there and I often

say the problem in my fraternity is many

people instead of doing their job spend

their whole life tweeting people ask me

why are you not on Twitter I said

because I have a job to do there are

some people who are unemployed

unemployable or becoming unemployable

I stopped by on the tomochka speaking on

and speaking please through your

permission I need a minute to explain

this first of all I'd like to

congratulate you thank you for stating

this I think you're the first journalist

who's actually said it publicly who's

quoted from the IAO theater I complement

my research for bringing this to my

notice we have a brilliant research team

got it to them so I think they'd be

friends Praful Allah may not comment on

it my dear friend submit mirror but I

want to do as an atheist who has no

bearing on Hindus or Muslims I want to

say this please listen to me for 30

seconds okay you have caught it

absolutely correctly that you cannot

talk about Kashian Mathura without

overturning the Supreme Court judgement

or reneging on the ACT people's worship

back 1991

I humbly disagree with the Supreme Court

but I expect I accept what they've said

I disagree with it for the following two

reasons one okay

the historical injustice has been

committed and if somebody wants to

correct it he should have the legal

recourse to approach the poor this is

just principle of natural justice

followed all over the world if you were

to ban someone from saying that I am

gobsmacked by what has happened the

historical and just in cash and mashra

matter but I cannot approach the court

in my sense in my view that is negating

the principles of natural justice but

because it threw me because all I'm

seeing said the right thing I I accept

what the Supreme Court had said I am NOT

for overturning it I'm not for reneging

on the bill 1994 but I humbly disagree

on it because of my view of denial of

natural justice you know the problem

happens when you do cross extremely

extreme holdups and I say one thing here

in the last because you would like to

comment on this also and I say one I

just like to read out as to what a

carpet ale has written in the concluding

paragraph he compares smoothie with

General Musharraf I cannot be honest he

says closer to our time General

Musharraf was validated in the same

fashion all the dictators have operated

under legal cover and this action and

their actions have been seen as

legitimate what is what the long-term

repercussions of ayodhya judgment are

will unfold in time but there will be

repercussions of course less than I hope

their consequences are not by going

under you as dangerous its warning of

violence moody is just a keen to General

Musharraf India's adolescent coffee or

there are dictators outs and ankle I

think firmly of the belief that this has

gone into writing only because Sonia has

a technology have this article should be

taken down and also expose

newspaper

you should Expo I'm you should hey

everyone is this random a shouting if

I'm speaking you or someone shows here

and finish em quote of India must say it

came down goat of India cream down and

why someone talks about you take him

down take him down 92 take it down

please take it down I said both of you

don't speak together

I said not this is not a carpet ale or

the Congress party talking against me or

Prime Minister III okay now you people

are making a mistake

can you come to me I make I make another

I I make I make another request early I

make another request today I repeat my

request today gentlemen please that if

one of you speaks at a time or two it

can be or don't do this please

and then can I make a public statement

now to you and through you profligate

car so you understand where I stand on

this don't do this again

you took the law into your own hands

in 1992 don't I request you

I'm getting an audio disturbance on the

side please I'm saying this to you today

so it's on live television I will not

forget 6th of December 1992

let anyone say anything but a generation

was destroyed after that and let us not

assume that whether Mundell happened or

above reemerged it happened out of sheer

social impulse no it was of political

impulse Oh

mr. Advani was leading a political

movement for political benefit of his

party shame now one minute I don't need

you to you know be my background score

the question I'm saying to you is this

I'm good I'm going to be interrupted

when I'm speaking you are pointing out

the fact I'm thankful you putting odds

of fact and Vanya and gang can I can I

say can I say this you know why do you

want to give

nyah-nyah called out at money for what

he did he just called out that one

generation was destroyed because of yes

[Applause]

okay thank you

what I'm saying to you is what can I say

one thing please okay Buffalo can I say

one thing to you and understand I don't

know the hard way you understand it's a

fate that any Kali Dorothy you know you

need to stop here don't don't do this

I'm saying to Hinduism is a syncretic

religion we can choose Hinduism is and

religion which evolves into ISM as a

syncretic religion does not need you now

to start going on the streets or talking

about Kashi and whatever I don't do it

we wanted near to be a superpower this

is not going to help us to your point of

historical wrongs historical wrongs have

happened in this country this is not one

of them

there are so many historical wrongs that

have happened in this country right are

we now going to go back to the

generations of changes current the

modeling and bother no watch watch it

can I can I say to you how many millions

of people were killed and butchers at

that point of time however I do not

identify barber with the religion the

difference is MA but I do not identify

barber with you

I'm sure I'm saying our Vice mom I am

saying this allow me allow me to

continue what I'm saying

continue what I'm saying is you don't

need to love me as the best journalist

I'm saying what I feel can I complete

what I'm saying why did this so many

interruptions I'll end it one sentence

Barbour is not a representative Indian

Muslims a barber can never be a

representing Indian Muslims be if barber

is that represent of Indian Muslims some

people try to portray they must also

think of us but they must think of a

most syncretic culture religions evolve

historical wrongs happen historical

wrongs are done by individuals you

cannot identify historical wrongs or

historical rights with religions with

communities for this generation this

generation cannot be made to pay the

price for a stereotyping because a

previous generation now now I won't I

want to move on I guess I want to move

on I don't want five lakh versus twenty

five lakh I don't want to rake up the

demolition of the Babri mulch it it's a

nightmare for me

I don't want to relive the nightmare

again and I ask you today on national

television I ask anyone I ask anyone I

will debate with you I don't want to

relive my nightmares I want to move on I

know their verdict has happened then

that be a temple let there be a mosque

and let's move on a I don't need that

you don't need one before the Rams in a

movie from you are asking me you are

seeing anyone who let's debate it

yes let's debate it why didn't you say

move on because because because then if

I if I don't worry

allow me to come see even in the

beginning I was talking why these issues

come up and why again and again we go

back to you know this history because

people do not want why this judgment is

beautiful because it has taken

historical archaeological and it has

analyzed everything and then given the

judgment it has allowed us that is the

first so first point I made cultural and

constitutional framework the second

point I made that is historical

archaeological and legal parameters

together in integrity we had to we could

reach to these conclusions then then

then thirdly third most important things

take a Mahmud was mentioned he made one

important statement during his Romanies

book he said the truth can be buried for

long time and distortions historians

historians actually did not allow

reconciliation sick-sick December was

outcome of that those historians you

know come to you we have life time could

justify karahi

important issue over here I just would

like to quote as to what the court has

said the five judges Supreme Court bench

has said the allotment of the land to

the Muslims is necessary because though

the balance of probabilities evidence

regarding claim of the Hindus to the

composite whole of the disputed property

stands on a better footing than the

evidence adduced by the Muslims but the

Muslims were disposed upon desecration

of mosque on 22nd 23rd December 1949

which was ultimately destroyed on 6

December 1992 so the court says a

balance has been maintained I firmly

believe that what the court says well

the evidences are in favor of the temple

so we are granting the land to the

temple but we are taking all the

communities together the Hindus and the

Muslims together five acres of land to

the Muslims I was astonished because of

the fact that OSE who himself said that

I have not gone to the judgement but

comes out just for politicizing the

issue and says that Mosul Managua karate

hie and the judges were trying to

propagate a Hindu to our nation we

should condemn in one voice what OSE

said but what in fact I would say as far

as anti-national activities conservatory

what takes the icing on the cake is the

article by the Congress today in the

National Herald that Supreme Court of

the country stands to condemn the

Congress party see and to compare the

Supreme Court of India the beautiful

Supreme Court of India the Constitution

of India with that of Pakistan today

just because your politics of

appeasement has come to an end

you don't want peace in the conveyor is

nothing all love peace is a matter of IV

Road in and we want

I want to make a broader point may I

make a broader point with your

permission I'll take exactly one minute

at the closing four minutes of the

debate you see why did you lose is

something we need to think about let me

explain why did the politicians lose no

no no no no I'm not I'm not about

communities I'm saying why did the lobby

lose all why does the lobby lose listen

to me

Nathan Nathan listen to me today today

at least listen to me I'm saying why do

the pseudos always lose they always ever

melt down this is not a conspiracy this

is because not because you are

politically weak but because you are

wrong it is not because you don't have a

well-oiled machinery but because you are

wrong it is not because you don't have a

voice but because you are wrong it is

not because you don't have funding but

because you are wrong it is not because

you don't have power but because you are

wrong you know something when you lose

and I take the example of the lower case

for example the judge lower case and I'm

slightly diverting at this point of the

debate members of the Luo Tian's floppy

like Prashant Bhushan salt over this

case and he said and he said who killed

him

who killed him what was the motive right

what happened the Supreme Court said

that facts showed the judge lawyer died

of natural causes and

right and and and and and and one with

winner in power was brought in by

Professor do I give you I give you a

second example I give you a second

example in case I get them I give you I

give you the second example one oh thank

you a second example when I render mode

a return to power you as in the lobby

started saying India's Muslims fear for

their future under this manner in Ramadi

the fact is Narendra Modi empowered 9

crore Muslim women by practing against

triple the luck then you did not speak

what I'm trying to say to you is that

you need to understand you are wrong

because you are wrong and when you are

wrong you can't do anything about it you

know you went about article 370 you

spread fake news about how the army is

using a mic to torture Kashmir is and

broadcast it to the streets even shall

Irish it could not prove our hearsay

statements about the army and the entire

narrative fell you know why not because

you are weak because you are wrong and

why are you

[Applause]

stop stop this political bravado of the

news knots Ram company Chiana I would

just like to conclude that this

beautiful beautiful judgment that came

yesterday shows one great important at

the lesson is India that was seen only

as a country of last 70 years post

independence in 1947 is just not a piece

of land of 70 years it is a civilization

oh and it quotes after quotes have

delivered and rally and the closure

shows that we are an important idea not

just a political entity and

congratulations to everyone

congratulation to everyone for the kind

of judgment that we have got yesterday

and I'm sorry we still have a which are

Daraa in this country who called the

limousine liberal society heavy who

feels like the

the left is a slipper

pooja is sanskritic Rajdhani de maria de

[Applause]

Ayana

what but the neighbors I have nothing to

say at the end of this debate we was but

I think the biggest lesson of idea that

I take away is the incredible strength

of our democracy that that real moment

here when Swami the punker came together

to us this up tells me that we can have

a debate like this and still come to it

we can have 135 years of a conflict and

still come together that is what the

greatest lesson of my idea is about for

you I hope you enjoy the program yours

as I always say it's a privilege we in

the history

you
