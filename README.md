# NLP_ayodhyaVerdict

This is a short project that I did to apply NLP concepts in real life and well I am not dissapointed.

## What am I doing?

There was a recent Ayodhya Verdict that came out for which the citizens and news channels have had long awaited for.I downloaded the subtitles of the debates of 3 different indian news channels and cleaned them up.

## What next?
I practiced the following NLP procedures on them:
<ol>
  <li>EDA</li>
  <li>Sentiment Analysis</li>
  <li>Topic Modelling</li>
  <li>Text Generation (didnt work out that well, but was fun xD)</li>
</ol>

#### This is purely for learning I have no intention to defame any channel or person, All the results that appear are not endorsed and are not expected to be exactly true due to lack of data collection time.
