       " [\"hello and welcome ladies and gentlemen\\n\\nthis is live edition of the Sunday\\n\\ndebate and yesterday we it was a\\n\\nhistoric day when the IOT a verdict came\\n\\nout many people expected that it would\\n\\nperhaps stagger over a three or four\\n\\nhour period there were questions about\\n\\nwhether it would be unanimous at all and\\n\\nthere was uncertainty about whether it\\n\\nwould be unanimous\\n\\nmany felt it could be a\\n\\nmajority-minority verdict and there was\\n\\na feeling that maybe this verdict could\\n\\nbe analyzed in great detail to find some\\n\\nlittle point of internal difference\\n\\nbetween the judges which could be played\\n\\ndown on and that also did not happen and\\n\\nthat was the most magnificent thing\\n\\nabout yesterday's IOD awarded so today\\n\\nwe've been through the tsunami of news\\n\\nyesterday it's a good time to sit back\\n\\nand reflect and then for the subject of\\n\\nthe Sunday debaters simply put the\\n\\nlessons of a yogya I'll do the\\n\\nintroductions later\\n\\nI just want both sides to first\\n\\nelaborate on their initial positions on\\n\\ntoday's debate before both sides put\\n\\ntheir initial positions let me put some\\n\\nof mine firstly I believe that there is\\n\\nan industry in this country which only\\n\\nand only lives off division this is a\\n\\nindustry which is picked up steam in the\\n\\nlast decade and the reason it has picked\\n\\nup steam in the last decade is it\\n\\nbecause it is a natural response of this\\n\\ngroup this cabal this Lobby to its own\\n\\ngrowing irrelevance for seventy years\\n\\nthis cabal has somehow managed to keep\\n\\nhold keep a stranglehold if I might say\\n\\nso over the power of paratus in this\\n\\ncountry and it's been almost taken for\\n\\ngranted that whichever section that\\n\\ncontrols power in this country whether\\n\\nit is state governments state\\n\\nlegislatures influential bodies academic\\n\\ninstitutions whether it be the legal\\n\\nfraternity the courts the government and\\n\\nof course the media\\n\\nthere has been a considerable hold of\\n\\nthis group over that apparatus in the\\n\\ncountry now in the last seven to eight\\n\\nyears particularly but over a period of\\n\\na decade this group has become\\n\\nirrelevant in terms of its\\n\\nrepresentation in all the mainstream\\n\\nareas principally arising out of the\\n\\nfact that in this country elections have\\n\\nforced the Congress out you went through\\n\\na period in which you've had National\\n\\nFront United Front governments and then\\n\\nyou have the emergence of the BJP\\n\\nthrough the late 90s so in the last 15\\n\\nyears particularly the emergence of the\\n\\nBJP the cyclical downturn that the\\n\\nCongress has gone through and I'll make\\n\\na longish introduction has led us to a\\n\\nsituation where this group does not win\\n\\nelections anymore and because it does\\n\\nnot win elections anymore because\\n\\ntherefore it's slowly over a period of\\n\\n10 years its control over the power of\\n\\nparatus has weakened now what did this\\n\\ngroup do as a response because it\\n\\nrealized that it was no longer able to\\n\\ncontrol power in India what did they do\\n\\nthey wanted to therefore then control\\n\\ninstitutions that control power in India\\n\\nthrough an indirect process whether it\\n\\nbe the legal fraternity whether it be\\n\\nthe media and law and media are very\\n\\ncritical and then perhaps less critical\\n\\nare the academic institutions and others\\n\\nbut law and media controlling the media\\n\\nand controlling the legal institutions\\n\\ncontrolling the judiciary was very\\n\\nimportant for them\\n\\nthe Ayodhya verdict and therefore I want\\n\\nto begin this with the longest\\n\\nintroduction I promised you that I will\\n\\nspeak a little less to the course of the\\n\\ndebate the IOD award it was very\\n\\nimportant because somewhere there was a\\n\\nfeeling among these people who I call\\n\\nthe lobby you can call them the remnants\\n\\nof the Congress which is now popularly\\n\\nknown as the Vadra Congress there was a\\n\\ngeneral feeling that the Ayodhya issue\\n\\ncould be managed in the courts and let's\\n\\nlet therefore begin with this premise\\n\\nthat that you could have delayed the\\n\\nverdict the longer you delay the verdict\\n\\nperhaps it would be possible to you know\\n\\nget more and more political advantage\\n\\nout of it did that happen no was that a\\n\\nbelief it could happen yes Rajeev\\n\\nDarwin's arguments couple\\n\\nsimple arguments let's today remember\\n\\nwhat they were trying to do they were\\n\\ntrying to delay the verdict the lesson\\n\\nof idea in my view the first lesson of\\n\\nour idea is you cannot play around with\\n\\nthe courts of this country the second\\n\\nlesson of idea in my view is that this\\n\\ncountry wants to move on\\n\\nif you see the response to the AODA\\n\\nverdict this country wants to move on it\\n\\ndoes not want to be hemmed in to what\\n\\nwas happening earlier and we now need to\\n\\nreconcile that we need to appreciate the\\n\\nfact then I have said this repeatedly\\n\\nthat there is an entire generation of\\n\\nIndians which is sick and tired of\\n\\npoliticians playing around in the name\\n\\nof secularism secularism is an abused\\n\\nword and therefore if I can just begin\\n\\nthe debate by asking both sides one\\n\\nperson from either side to elaborate on\\n\\ntheir positions on this subject you can\\n\\ngive me your perspective let me\\n\\nintroduce the guest this evening to my\\n\\nright summit para national spokesperson\\n\\nof the BJP truffula kate curve editor of\\n\\nthe organizer anand Ranganathan author\\n\\nand scientist who is our Jane you\\n\\nrepresentative on the program the city\\n\\nswami dipankar founder and chairman of\\n\\nthe department foundation ari quick val\\n\\nis a congress leaning political analyst\\n\\na lama Bernardino M Hassan II is the\\n\\ngeneral secretary of the All India ulema\\n\\nboard Shaitan Singh is a congress\\n\\nanti-bjp political analyst and Nishant\\n\\nVerma needs no introduction he's come\\n\\nhere without his Gandhi topi today maybe\\n\\nis making a partner trophy now which is\\n\\nmore relevant for today's times let's\\n\\nbegin the debate we also must understand\\n\\nthat there is a group of people who have\\n\\nbeen sulking since yesterday I call them\\n\\nthe pseudos and whether it's in social\\n\\nmedia columns videos they are simply\\n\\nsulking they do not want the integration\\n\\nand unity of the country and they've\\n\\nbeen abusing the judiciary indirectly\\n\\nsince yesterday so which side would like\\n\\nto start on lesson survey okay which\\n\\nside some it wants to make the first go\\n\\ngo ahead you add does he have your\\n\\npermission to start he does okay\\n\\nsomebody go\\n\\nother first and foremost congratulations\\n\\nthrough your channel to millions of\\n\\nIndians congratulation to the panel and\\n\\nto you as well because this was the\\n\\nlongest case going on in India and we\\n\\nhave a closer yesterday yeah so I\\n\\nbelieve every Indian need to at least\\n\\ncelebrate within if not upon poster\\n\\ndisplay that but then we need to\\n\\ncelebrate our judicial system number two\\n\\nif you would say that there was a\\n\\ndelaying tactics it was delaying tactics\\n\\nversus decision and decision is the one\\n\\nwhich has won the best thing about this\\n\\njudgement or not that we all need to\\n\\nreally take away home is the unanimity\\n\\nunanimity not just among the judges\\n\\nunanimity across the country barring a\\n\\nfew whom you call the pseudos or whom\\n\\nyou call the liberal gang et cetera et\\n\\ncetera the lobbyists bearing them the\\n\\nwhole of the country in fact is\\n\\nunanimous to the fact that we have won\\n\\nnot the Hindus nor the Muslims India has\\n\\nwon this anonymity is there secondly the\\n\\nmost important thing that we need to\\n\\ntake away home today is it's not on\\n\\nfaith but on evi\",\n",
       "  \"dence yeah that the\\n\\ncourt has decided and come out with a\\n\\nverdict the court has said that well yes\\n\\nit's not in faith of anyone we are blind\\n\\nto the faith of everyone in this country\\n\\nwell we only are looking towards the\\n\\nconstitution of this country and the\\n\\nConstitution guarantees certain rights\\n\\nto every citizen based on evidences\\n\\nempirical evidences scientific evidences\\n\\nthe ASI the the gadget is that the tour\\n\\nguides etc they have come up with this\\n\\njudgment so no one needs to really sulk\\n\\nin this this is a scientific judgment\\n\\nand most importantly I would say in this\\n\\nthat remember as far as the Constitution\\n\\nof India as far as secularism is\\n\\nconcerned this is a victory of\\n\\nsecularism mr. Koester because four long\\n\\nyears 161 years the people of this\\n\\ncountry patiently waited way back in\\n\\n1885 we had one of their lawsuits\\n\\nopening up and yesterday when the\\n\\nclosure came one thing was proved that\\n\\nwe waited patiently we did not kill we\\n\\ndid not fight we took our recourse\\n\\nthrough the courts of this country to\\n\\nthe conclusion lastly my thanks to KK\\n\\nMohammed as well here is a man who said\\n\\nthat there were certain historians this\\n\\ndis the whole debate was about dis\\n\\ntorian's versus historians as well there\\n\\nwere some

of\\n\\nobviously and I would like to conclude\\n\\nby saying for God's sake the media\\n\\nshould take a vow not to show the\\n\\nstatement of a divisionist that is mr.\\n\\nOSE he is trying to divide this country\\n\\nin the name of religion and I would say\\n\\nthat we all have to be extremely\\n\\nresponsible as has been called upon us\\n\\nby the respected Prime Minister of the\\n\\ncountry\\n\\nyeh Jordan Iike or Durrani kasama he\\n\\nmight make as a man nahi you know as\\n\\nthis thank you for in initial comments\\n\\nI'll come in with some of mine as this\\n\\nverdict came in yesterday\\n\\nthere were two events which were\\n\\nhappening one is there was a group of\\n\\npeople in this country who suddenly felt\\n\\nhow could this happen how can you have a\\n\\nverdict in half now there was a sense of\\n\\nshock because what was IOT about in the\\n\\ncourts it was about delay it was about\\n\\nwrenching it it was about as they say to\\n\\nHindi make Athena his coach ethnic\\n\\neating it with monitoring him jitna\\n\\nteaching he put not batting jitna\\n\\nteaching Gaona in the Muslim Korean game\\n\\nor fil tanga km secular him his key\\n\\nresponse mayor yesterday when the word\\n\\nit came there was a sense of shock among\\n\\nthose people yesterday yoga he seek a\\n\\nbassist Peter Marie Dukan a charity so I\\n\\nthink the lesson of my idea is that five\\n\\njudges come together and they carve out\\n\\na verdict that makes the rule of our law\\n\\nand our Constitution supreme the pseudo\\n\\nseculars will now have to find a new\\n\\nformula who'd like to start from this\\n\\nside please tonight please go ahead\\n\\nwould like to start from this side it is\\n\\nwho's making the pose make the\\n\\nintroductory it comes from your side if\\n\\nI may thank you we all respect the\\n\\nSupreme Court\\n\\nwe all respect the Constitution of India\\n\\nand India this is doubtless\\n\\nthe judgment has been delivered\\n\\nyesterday everyone has respected the\\n\\njudgment but then definitely there are\\n\\nsegments within the litigants as well as\\n\\ncountry who are not accepting it in toto\\n\\nand there are reasons for that the study\\n\\nof the judgment along with the\\n\\ndocumentation which was provided in the\\n\\ncase matter it is being studied about it\\n\\nis very clear that one of the litigants\\n\\nis still unclear whether they will go\\n\\nfor a revision or not which is near\\n\\nMaria Cara and definitely some people\\n\\nrealize over and definitely I wish some\\n\\npeople realized at least now you know\\n\\nthey are worried this is some yesterday\\n\\nthis is the this is important you see\\n\\nand as well as the Muslim Personal Law\\n\\nBoard is still unclear whether they will\\n\\ngo into the vision or not now that\\n\\nhaving having said that we must\\n\\nunderstand that a judgement needs to be\\n\\nunderstood first off have you read my\\n\\njudgement have you have you remember\\n\\ncoming to that so you know once you've\\n\\nmade a watch have you read the judgment\\n\\nyou did not interrupt then I'm asking if\\n\\nI got the judge right have you read the\\n\\njudgment yes I have gone through the\\n\\nsixth I've not slept all night not in\\n\\nbecause of in reading you've slept all\\n\\nthat that's been mentioned from you\\n\\neating the judgment I've been reading\\n\\nthe judgment I've only been writing an\\n\\narticle for the lie of I have been only\\n\\nable to do a 65% of reading till now it\\n\\nis a long judgment anybody who says that\\n\\nin two minutes or five minutes I can do\\n\\nthat then it's off the hook\\n\\nso only 65% I have been able to read and\\n\\nstudy till now it's more than thousand\\n\\npages it's not about reading a book it's\\n\\nreading a judgement I must emphasize\\n\\nhere that very morning by the way sorry\\n\\nwhy are you in mourning no it's good\\n\\nmorning it's not morning because when\\n\\nyou are reading a judgment it's a good\\n\\nthing to do we must understand that all\\n\\nthe judgments can be if any lacuna is\\n\\nwrong can be questioned as to your\\n\\nthoughts seems to be a lot\\n\\nyou feel cold the only thing is I'm\\n\\nputting it in a very calm manner because\\n\\nit's a serious matter\\n\\nokay I'm borrowing this line from some\\n\\ngoodbye he many times says that this is\\n\\na very serious matter I'm copying it\\n\\nfrom you thank you that this is a very\\n\\nserious matter and it has to be a judge\\n\\nit has been adjudged thoroughly it needs\\n\\nto be understood and digested thoroughly\\n\\ntry office I go to the point please I\\n\\nmean are you finding it right it's an\\n\\nopening comment please like the three\\n\\nspeed breakers already which have come\\n\\nin so allow the vehicle to go slow which\\n\\nI'm trying to drive there are there are\\n\\nprime FS a train engines in the ad in\\n\\nthe judgement and those questions will\\n\\nrise they have not erosion yet they'll\\n\\nrise they will be questioned that's it\\n\\nwhat more do you should we open the beam\\n\\na fight you know I don't want to fight\\n\\nshould we should we should we should\\n\\nokay okay one thing is there that today\\n\\nfor bgo day once a BJP if I can add a\\n\\nline mark isn't a party\\n\\nyou have been underlined by the Supreme\\n\\nCourt that in 1992 you did not go with\\n\\ngarlands so at least you as a party\\n\\nshall not preach to this country about\\n\\nharmony evolution this because God may I\\n\\nmay please now yeah but I won't and I\\n\\nwill tell you on the 7th of December\\n\\n1992 their own Member of Parliament now\\n\\nsubramanyam Swami said that BG edit RSS\\n\\nand vhp must be booked under Dada\\n\\nso I am still not using the heavy words\\n\\nthat Subramanyam Swami there BJP used\\n\\nbecause patatas was for terrorists yeah\\n\\nokay now now III I just I just I I will\\n\\nI will who believe it's your I know 100\\n\\ndo you see I wanna do this crosstalk\\n\\ntoday night so I'm saying no crosstalk\\n\\ntoday which means you take it through me\\n\\nthank you\\n\\nand Mike if we take it you take it\\n\\nthrough me right you don't look at each\\n\\nother and engage in your own\\n\\nconversations if you do that I'm walking\\n\\nout of the debate okay so so yesterday\\n\\nlet's think about what happened\\n\\nyesterday what is apparent to me Nishant\\n\\nfrom hearing you and I heard\\n\\nwell is that you have not come to terms\\n\\nwith yesterday and I I gen\",\n",
       "  \"uinely want to\\n\\ntell you and chitin and everybody come\\n\\nto terms with it this is now over let us\\n\\nlet me say this looking at each one of\\n\\nyou wherever you're watching this\\n\\nprogram today this is over the moment I\\n\\nsay this is over\\n\\npeople like Michonne sitting here say no\\n\\nit is not and I say when this was the\\n\\nlast time he says no it will not be the\\n\\nlast time when I say we will not have\\n\\nanymore conflict he will say no we will\\n\\ncontinue to have more conflict why\\n\\nbecause he seeks the conflict he wants\\n\\nthe fight yesterday Suvarna cui came on\\n\\nmy program and I want to say this how\\n\\nshocked and horrified I was at what she\\n\\nwas doing yesterday she came on my\\n\\nprogram and she said I want a guarantee\\n\\nnow and I said let us let us celebrate\\n\\nthe verdict she said no I want to\\n\\nguarantee got a body I was sitting where\\n\\nyou were sitting\\n\\nhe said I want a guarantee from the BJP\\n\\nthat you will now not pick up Kashi that\\n\\nyou will not pick up Mathura the I said\\n\\nto her that I am really horrified\\n\\nbecause how can you talk about Kashi and\\n\\nMathura today she said no I need a\\n\\nguarantee wait a minute and I said but\\n\\nyou know have they raised Kashi and\\n\\nMathura she said no I want a guarantee\\n\\nfrom them then I looked at her and I\\n\\nsaid I find it completely surprising and\\n\\nshocking that you are raising Kashi in\\n\\nMathura wait a minute wait a minute wait\\n\\na minute look the government is not why\\n\\nyou are you are raking your one-minute\\n\\none you are raking it up when you\\n\\nshouldn't when we want closure you want\\n\\nthings to linger I'm following me\\n\\nviewers and I say this to you sincerely\\n\\ntoday that they want this to linger for\\n\\na while and then catapult again because\\n\\nyoga band oh yeah doohickey occurring is\\n\\nthat is my only point to that the lesson\\n\\nof IO dia is to understand the country\\n\\nhas moved on now you move on you move on\\n\\nas well quietly and in discipline if you\\n\\ndare to and I put a statutory warning to\\n\\nyou if you dare to do this again agar\\n\\naapke motto if you say Hindu Muslim\\n\\nfacade suru Kenickie - sorry - kitchen\\n\\nKotaku Behar cardiga carding the right\\n\\nhand Pahlavi AHIMA tato in this hunt I\\n\\nhave I have a point to make and then\\n\\nafter that video permission with your\\n\\npermission yeah see what I understood\\n\\nwhatever little I understood of what\\n\\nMichonne spoke is that he's mean\\n\\nlet everyone see has not slept the whole\\n\\nnight yesterday trying to read and he\\n\\nhas said this umpteen number of type the\\n\\njudgment needs to be understood judgment\\n\\nneeds to be understood saying that he\\n\\nhas come here to the debate today one of\\n\\nthe most important debates of India\\n\\nwithout understanding the judgment and\\n\\nsecondly he has said that some questions\\n\\nmay arise in the future they have not a\\n\\nrosin as yet but they may arise in the\\n\\nfuture so this kind of caviar set in the\\n\\nfuture we may sham the judges we may\\n\\nshamed the judges we may fight against\\n\\nthem I would request my good friend Jean\\n\\nthen please don't strain your vocal\\n\\ncurls I mean since you have not\\n\\nunderstood the judgment please you take\\n\\nthis two hours time to read the 45 pages\\n\\nthat are still left since 65% age top\\n\\nearly I must allow the debate is not\\n\\nbetween two of no but the lessons are\\n\\nyogya fatal essence of a yogi of a\\n\\nsubject here to interpret what I am\\n\\ntrying to say is respect means what\\n\\ninterpretation submit pathology is\\n\\nsimple that as you have peddle the\\n\\nnarrative of 370 across all elections in\\n\\nin state poop you not going to peddle\\n\\nthis narrative first lesson second\\n\\nlesson from this is that the\\n\\nconstruction contract we come up\\n\\nI will come in no crosstalk but you will\\n\\ncome animal tracks everything in every\\n\\nunanimous address come concerns for\\n\\ncompanies to be given the contracts or\\n\\ndo you see I can make my point whether\\n\\nthen you don't want say we see don't\\n\\nspeak over it so see the Animus ruffle\\n\\nencouragement and on the top of it you\\n\\nsee they have used 142 article 142 which\\n\\nSupreme Court judges can use and on the\\n\\ntop of it it's a 1045 pay judgment they\\n\\nalso what absolutely clear out here that\\n\\nthis is going to come up with a full\\n\\nstop on politics and religion\\n\\nso now onward there should not be any\\n\\npolitics on religion right so there's a\\n\\nlot of you can ask you one question\\n\\nchitin yet that politics in the end can\\n\\nI ask you one thing I can ask you\\n\\nanything this applies to the media as\\n\\nwell as you absolutely yeah\\n\\nso it's not just politicians who need to\\n\\nbe responsible you believe the media\\n\\nneeds to be responsible what do you do\\n\\nwhen certain sections of the media want\\n\\nto break up the country I think it's a\\n\\ntime to expose them exposed UM's may I\\n\\nwith your permission exposed instead of\\n\\ncelebrating the historic judgment which\\n\\nends the dispute certain members of the\\n\\nLuo Tian's media put out this article\\n\\nyesterday saying how Modi's kashi\\n\\nvishwanath corridor is laying the ground\\n\\nfor another Babri incident and and i\\n\\nquote how Modi's koshy which were not\\n\\ncalled as laying the ground for a Babri\\n\\nincident certain members of the Luo\\n\\nTian's media sharing articles on the\\n\\ndemolition of the babri masjid titled\\n\\nnation's shame when it was very clear\\n\\nthat it was said that don't provoke\\n\\nyesterday whole countries coming\\n\\ntogether I tell you one thing I have\\n\\nbeen speaking to a cross-section of\\n\\npeople across the country yesterday can\\n\\nordinary people you know people watching\\n\\nthis in their homes yesterday they came\\n\\nout I know that in various parts of the\\n\\ncountry including the national capital\\n\\nHindus and Muslims came together they\\n\\nhad a meal together yes they had a cup\\n\\nof tea together\\n\\nthey discussed this together and\\n\\neverybody said of America and submit a\\n\\nbirth but the Luo Tian's media de banana\\n\\nde kum Babri Masjid demolition key\\n\\nvisuals the karate and they wrote with\\n\\nthe caption\\n\\nmemory in the age of amnesia I mean this\\n\\nkind of a line\\n\\nit's a judicial deliberation you have\\n\\nbeen saying it's a beautiful worded it's\\n\\na wonderfully constructed verdict right\\n\\nsome people have been calling it\\n\\njugglery the case was about the IOD\\n\\nisland dispute it was not about the\\n\\nBarbary demolition was it about Barbary\\n\\ndemolition no that case is still going\\n\\non right so why is this Luo Tian's media\\n\\nmany of whom are doing things that are\\n\\nagainst national interests now when I\\n\\ncall them anti-national they jump in\\n\\nthis city why calling us and pigeon but\\n\\nthey still have come kuroky today 0d do\\n\\nbut hang up go no no my question is\\n\\nyesterday they said somebody said\\n\\nforwarded a tweet saying first the dome\\n\\nof the Babri Masjid caved in some days\\n\\nlater the Supreme Court's no no some\\n\\ndays later the Supreme Court's caved it\\n\\nthey were saying that the Supreme Court\\n\\nwas demolished yesterday you know why\\n\\nI'm asking you Chetan why why reasonably\\n\\nbecause you know sometimes what happens\\n\\npeople ignition today is the voice and\\n\\nthey think they make the I see why why\\n\\nlisten why why are you because you are\\n\\nlosers why do you want to destroy now\\n\\nthe Supreme Court of the country why are\\n\\nyou doing things against our country's\\n\\ninterest why you so selfish why you us\\n\\nin this Lobby so narrow-minded you know\\n\\nyou realize the people of India hated\\n\\nthis Lobby

collagen is\\n\\ncollagen\\n\\n- The Prodigy memory cool Rodney\\n\\nDiGiacomo like but any applicable\\n\\n[Applause]\\n\\nimportant issue over here I just would\\n\\nlike to quote as to what the court has\\n\\nsaid the five judges Supreme Court bench\\n\\nhas said the allotment of the land to\\n\\nthe Muslims is necessary because though\\n\\nthe balance of probabilities evidence\\n\\nregarding claim of the Hindus to the\\n\\ncomposite whole of the disputed property\\n\\nstands on a better footing than the\\n\\nevidence adduced by the Muslims but the\\n\\nMuslims were disposed upon desecration\\n\\nof mosque on 22nd 23rd December 1949\\n\\nwhich was ultimately destroyed on 6\\n\\nDecember 1992 so the court says a\\n\\nbalance has been maintained I firmly\\n\\nbelieve that what the court says well\\n\\nthe evidences are in favor of the temple\\n\\nso we are granting the land to the\\n\\ntemple but we are taking all the\\n\\ncommunities together the Hindus and the\\n\\nMuslims together five acres of land to\\n\\nthe Muslims I was astonished because of\\n\\nthe fact that OSE who himself said that\\n\\nI have not gone to the judgement but\\n\\ncomes out just for politicizing the\\n\\nissue and says that Mosul Managua karate\\n\\nhie and the judges were trying to\\n\\npropagate a Hindu to our nation we\\n\\nshould condemn in one voice what OSE\\n\\nsaid but what in fact I would say as far\\n\\nas anti-national activities conservatory\\n\\nwhat takes the icing on the cake is the\\n\\narticle by the Congress today in the\\n\\nNational Herald that Supreme Court of\\n\\nthe country stands to condemn the\\n\\nCongress party see and to compare the\\n\\nSupreme Court of India the beautiful\\n\\nSupreme Court of India the Constitution\\n\\nof India with that of Pakistan today\\n\\njust because your politics of\\n\\nappeasement has come to an end\\n\\nyou don't want peace in the conveyor is\\n\\nnothing all love peace is a matter of IV\\n\\nRoad in and we want\\n\\nI want to make a broader point may I\\n\\nmake a broader point with your\\n\\npermission I'll take exactly one minute\\n\\nat the closing four minutes of the\\n\\ndebate you see why did you lose is\\n\\nsomething we need to think about let me\\n\\nexplain why did the politicians lose no\\n\\nno no no no I'm not I'm not about\\n\\ncommunities I'm saying why did the lobby\\n\\nlose all why does the lobby lose listen\\n\\nto me\\n\\nNathan Nathan listen to me today today\\n\\nat least listen to me I'm saying why do\\n\\nthe pseudos always lose they always ever\\n\\nmelt down this is not a conspiracy this\\n\\nis because not because you are\\n\\npolitically weak but because you are\\n\\nwrong it is not because you don't have a\\n\\nwell-oiled machinery but because you are\\n\\nwrong it is not because you don't have a\\n\\nvoice but because you are wrong it is\\n\\nnot because you don't have funding but\\n\\nbecause you are wrong it is not because\\n\\nyou don't have power but because you are\\n\\nwrong you know something when you lose\\n\\nand I take the example of the lower case\\n\\nfor example the judge lower case and I'm\\n\\nslightly diverting at this point of the\\n\\ndebate members of the Luo Tian's floppy\\n\\nlike Prashant Bhushan salt over this\\n\\ncase and he said and he said who killed\\n\\nhim\\n\\nwho killed him what was the motive right\\n\\nwhat happened the Supreme Court said\\n\\nthat facts showed the judge lawyer died\\n\\nof natural causes and\\n\\nright and and and and and and one with\\n\\nwinner in power was brought in by\\n\\nProfessor do I give you I give you a\\n\\nsecond example I give you a second\\n\\nexample in case I get them I give you I\\n\\ngive you the second example one oh thank\\n\\nyou a second example when I render mode\\n\\na return to power you as in the lobby\\n\\nstarted saying India's Muslims fear for\\n\\ntheir future under this manner in Ramadi\\n\\nthe fact is Narendra Modi empowered 9\\n\\ncrore Muslim women by practing against\\n\\ntriple the luck then you did not speak\\n\\nwhat I'm trying to say to you is that\\n\\nyou need to understand you are wrong\\n\\nbecause you are wrong and when you are\\n\\nwrong you can't do anything about it you\\n\\nknow you went about article 370 you\\n\\nspread fake news about how the army is\\n\\nusing a mic to torture Kashmir is and\\n\\nbroadcast it to the streets even shall\\n\\nIrish it could not prove our hearsay\\n\\nstatements about the army and the entire\\n\\nnarrative fell you know why not because\\n\\nyou are weak because you are wrong and\\n\\nwhy are you\\n\\n[Applause]\\n\\nstop stop this political bravado of the\\n\\nnews knots Ram company Chiana I would\\n\\njust like to conclude that this\\n\\nbeautiful beautiful judgment that came\\n\\nyesterday shows one great important at\\n\\nthe lesson is India that was seen only\\n\\nas a country of last 70 years post\\n\\nindependence in 1947 is just not a piece\\n\\nof land of 70 years it is a civilization\\n\\noh and it quotes after quotes have\\n\\ndelivered and rally and the closure\\n\\nshows that we are an important idea not\\n\\njust a political entity and\\n\\ncongratulations to everyone\\n\\ncongratulation to everyone for the kind\\n\\nof judgment that we have got yesterday\\n\\nand I'm sorry we still have a which are\\n\\nDaraa in this country who called the\\n\\nlimousine liberal society heavy who\\n\\nfeels like the\\n\\nthe left is a slipper\\n\\npooja is sanskritic Rajdhani de maria

mir-21\\n\\n[Applause]\\n\\nAyana\\n\\nwhat but the neighbors I have nothing to\\n\\nsay at the end of this debate we was but\\n\\nI think the biggest lesson of idea that\\n\\nI take away is the incredible strength\\n\\nof our democracy that that real moment\\n\\nhere when Swami the punker came together\\n\\nto us this up tells me that we can have\\n\\na debate like this and still come to it\\n\\nwe can have 135 years of a conflict and\\n\\nstill come together that is what the\\n\\ngreatest lesson of my idea is about for\\n\\nyou I hope you enjoy the program yours\\n\\nas I always say
